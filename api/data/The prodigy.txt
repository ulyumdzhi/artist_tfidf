Yo, I used to check out lyrics upon the formats
Built with skill with technique, computer ADAT
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped, think, thought, flow, acrobat
Sync the track, pump the track
Dance missions clubs like spores react by strobe visions
And hurrying more reflects on the dance floor
Blowing up, and having mad people showing up
Packing crowds, jam packed venues
Needles collapse while atmosphere continues
Sprinkle that, win it like that, move it like that
Hitting like that, the melody is phat
Yo, I'm on the energy source
The cosmic boss with Prodigy
Flipping astrology
My intellects devour, with diesel power

(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantas-)

Win, spin back, rewind, diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
It has to be, automatically, check it out
You'd better work it out, change to another route
My techniques, strategies, abilities
I leave cords to mics hanging like spring leaves
Doing tracks so fast, beyond the human eye
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
E's and pepped up, you get swept up
Smacked up, backed up, your crew's all cracked up
Check it, slow pitch, who's quick, you can't stick
My metaphor range is strange as angles
You get tangled, twist inside affections
Channels repeat, complete, can't compete
Check the hour texture, mind adventure
Exploit the point into tracks, to devour
My intellects proceed, with diesel power

(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantas-)

Back attack the wack packs you faxing me
You don't want none, high quality action, be
Still standing, damaging your other manning
Quick reverse, potent as the first verse
My amplifier, blows on your world's higher
World sire, cuts like a barbed wire
Record player, I pull up on you everyday
Fast forward, I move and I swing toward
Exit load, put your brain in right mode
Select and mix, the man will perfect and fix
Heads lightly, bite me, copy, xerox
Cock sand blocks, you can't knocks, I'm out there
Upbeat, lifting, shifting
Persistent intelligent kingpin
Peeping astrology
As I roll with Prodigy, with diesel power

(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantas-)

You can see me coming from a mile off
Once again ignite the skyline
She's gonna be printed on money
Just like your royal family
(This ain't no holiday)
This time there can be no funeral
I'm vibing, can't you feel me?
We love Rohypnol
She got Rohypnol
We take Rohypnol
Just forget it all
We love Rohypnol
She got Rohypnol
We take Rohypnol
Just forget it all
Just forget it all
This baby's got a temper
This baby's got a temper
This baby's got a temper
You'll never tame her
You can see me do another parallel
Better bow down, you're not worthy
(Hey, get off my planet)
(Get off my planet, yeah)
Last time I'll be your prisoner
No name, no number
(No name!)
(Revolving, dissolving)
Shooting through the trap door
What I think don't matter anymore
(I'm vibing, can't you feel me?)
We love Rohypnol
She got Rohypnol
We take Rohypnol
Just forget it all
We love Rohypnol
She got Rohypnol

If you believe the western sun is falling down on everyone
If you're breaking free and the morning's come
If you would know your time has come
If you believe the western sun is falling down on everyone
If you're feeling firm, then I'll travel on
If you feel it burn, your time has come
And I feel it
You feel another energy and I feel a power growing
You feel another energy and I feel a power grow
You feel another energy and I feel a power grow
If you believe the western sun is falling down on everyone
If you're breaking free and the morning's come
If you would know your time has come
If you believe the western sun is falling down on everyone
And you feel it burn, don't try to run
And you feel it burn, your time has come
I feel it!
You feel another energy and I feel a power growing
You feel another energy and I feel a power grow
You feel another energy and I feel a power grow
Om Namo Narayana
Om Namo Narayana
Om Namo Narayana
Om Namo Narayana
Om Namo Narayana
I feel it
I feel it
You feel another energy...
