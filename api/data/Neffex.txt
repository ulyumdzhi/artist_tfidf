You're never gonna make it, you're not good enough
There's a million other people with the same stuff
You really think you're different? Man, you must be kiddin'
Think you're gonna hit it, but you just don't get it
It's impossible, it's not probable
You're irresponsible, too many obstacles
You gotta stop it, yo, you gotta take it slow
You can't be a pro, don't waste your time no more
Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?
I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove
I'm gonna make my move, I'm gonna make it soon
And I'll do it 'cause it's what I want to fucking do
'cause all these opinions and all these positions
They're coming in millions, they're blocking your vision
But no, you can't listen, that shit is all fiction
'cause you hold the power as long as you're driven

You're never gonna make it
There's no way that you make it
Yeah, maybe you can fake it
But you're never gonna make it
Are you just gonna take that?
Make 'em take it all back
Don't tell me you believe that
Are you just gonna take that?
Or will you fucking fight back?
Or will you fucking fight back?

You ain't gonna make it, you ain't never ever gonna break it
You can never beat 'em, man, they're better than you, face it
Thinking that they give a damn, you're not thinking straight kid
Nah, they don't give a damn, you got what I'm sayin'?
I'm not fucking playin', I'll give it to you straight, man
There's too many others and you're not that great, man
Stop what you're sayin', stop what you're makin'
Everybody here knows that you're just fakin'
Nah, I don't wanna hear it anymore
I don't wanna hear it anymore
All these fucking thoughts, they are not what I need anymore
I'm about to shut the motherfucking door
On all you poor ass haters with your heads in the clouds
Talkin' out loud, so proud
You better shut your goddamn mouths
Before I do more than speak out, it's about to head south

You're never gonna make it
There's no way that you make it
Yeah, maybe you can fake it
But you're never gonna make it
Are you just gonna take that?
Make 'em take it all back
Don't tell me you believe that
Are you just gonna take that?
Or will you fucking fight back?
Or will you fucking fight back?32EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
She's got some nice long hair
And you know that she's a bad chick
All the boys stare
Can't help it it's a habit
Clothes that she wears
Short skirt and a jacket
I just wanna get her all alone
On a mattress
I just wanna have it
I just gotta have it
Rumors all around say her body is fantastic
All natural, not a piece of her is plastic
Head to her toes yea they say that she's elastic
Yea the whispers all around say she has a reputation
Don't believe it 'till I see it so I want a demonstration
And I've always learned it better with a hands on education
So I need a private session if you get what I am saying
And they say that she's not easy no she's really complicated
But that only makes it better and it's got me so fixated
And I'm not the type to wait around I've never hesitated
But shes got me captivated so the game I'm gonna play it yea

She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
I want that body baby show me
Yeah
I heard you look good in a sundress
I heard you look good when you're undressed
I heard you like to get away
I heard you like to stay out late
I heard you had a couple boyfriends
I heard they didn't treat you right
I heard you're hated by your girlfriends
Cause all the guys want you tonight
They say she's too hot they say she's too cold
Where she came from nobody really knows
They say she looks young but say she acts old
From everything I've heard she gets out of control
And all the boys say she was sent from the heavens
But I'm not too sure that this girl is a blessing
She's got the devils eyes and they'll cut you like a weapon
She's stuck in my mind like a bad obsession
Got bad intentions

She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
I want that body baby show me
She's got a body like a coke fiend

These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me

Yeah, I don't believe in destiny
I just do what's best for me
Don't listen to my enemies
They're just full of jealousy
Yeah, this legacy
You gon' see what's left of me
You gon' see success in me
You ain't seen the rest of me
I just wanna be the best at what I know
Better than the rest, just watch me grow
Put me to the test and watch me go
This is my quest, I'ma make it known
They call me obsessive, oh, I know
Call me selective with my notes
Call me aggressive with my flow
Call me offensive even though

Yo, we ain't gonna lie, life's tough
Try to get by, life's rough
Try to do right, it's not enough
Even though you try you still mess up
But I'm still gonna fight for what I love
Still gonna die for what I love
Still gonna try, I won't give up
Still gonna fight until I've won
They say I'm way too obsessed
And I've got nothing left
And I'm not quite there yet
But those words, they'll regret
'Cause I got something left
And I'm not giving in
I will not let them win
I won't stop till the end, no


I've been through some injuries
Mentally and physically
Studied them religiously
So, I don't repeat history
And people won't admit to me
They don't want a victory
Bad enough to get it, see
They'd rather just go leave it be
And oh, this journey
I've been on since thirteen
Working hard and learning
Never stopping searching
Yeah, it's burning
All this passion hurts me
I took action working
Writing down these words, see
No, I'm not okay
I just wanna be something
I don't wanna be nothing
Living all alone
No, I'm not alright
I'm just barely getting by
But I'll tell you I'm just fine
So, you leave me alone

They say I'm way too obsessed
And I've got nothing left
And I'm not quite there yet
But those words, they'll regret
'Cause I got something left
And I'm not giving in
I will not let them win
I won't stop till the end, no

I have a dream, that's all I need
I'll make it happen with some work and belief
Know what I want, so I'll take it on
I've made mistakes but mistakes make you strong
Let's break it down for a minute, I want the crown, I'm gon get it
You hear me loud, man, I'm winnin', yeah, Charley Sheen would be grinnin'
These ladies know that I'm sinnin' and this is just the beginnin'
I'm closing in the ninth inning, there ain't no point in resistin'
Living life like a dream, ive it right, that's the theme
Every night, got a team, mobbing tight to the scene
Out on stage, hear 'em scream, okay, this the dream
And I prayed as a teen, one day it'd be me
If I want it then I get it, head down, don't regret it
Push myself to the limit, if I play it then I win it
I'm just saying, I'm just living for today, for a minute
I don't stay, I just visit, have no shame, I'll admit it, yeah

They looking right at me
To see if I succeed
To see if I believe
They looking up to me

They want it now, they want it now
Oh damn, if they want it now, then they've got it now

I swear to god, man, I'ma make it soon
Silence all the haters as they see us making moves
I do what I want, so I got nothing to prove
Staying motivated, teaching others what to do
I'm staying focused, my mind is open
They start to notice that I'm in motion
There is no potion, you're not just chosen
It takes devotion to stay composed man
Never stop, never stall, there ain't no time to fall
Try to live, get it all, you got one life to ball
Thinking big, never small, 'cause you gotta want it all
When you finally get that call, you get ready, take it all
I don't need a handout, I already standout
Starting to advance now, ready to expand now
You don't have a chance now, 'cause we're in demand now
Make it by the grand now, feeling in command now
They looking right at me
To see if I succeed
To see if I believe
They looking up to me

They want the best of me now, best of me now

(It's so cold outside)
(I'm alone, I'm alright)
Yeah

Everybody knows that I'm breaking down
Everybody knows I ain't fakin' now
Everybody knows my heart's vacant now
Yeah, she hates me now, I made mistakes, but now
I don't ever wanna be alone, I don't really ever feel at home
On my own, in the zone
That's the only way I know, feelin' low
'bout to blow back up, here I go
I will never let the doubt creep in
Gotta pop a couple more aspirin
I don't think I'll ever let you in
Easier to break it off as friends
I don't really understand myself
I don't really understand, need help
I don't wanna be left on the shelf
Couldn't even hear me if I yelled

It's so cold outside
I'm alone, I'm alright
It's so cold outside
I'm alone, I'm alright
(It's so cold outside)
(I'm alone, I'm alright)

(I'm alone, I'm alright)
(It's so cold outside)
(I'm alone, I'm alright)

Yeah, let's go

I don't wanna break down, always feel like I could break now
But I never let it take me to that place now
I won't ever let my thoughts get away now
I got better things to do, picking fate now
I just wanna be the best, call me great now
I don't know if I'm okay or insane now
I remember better days on the playground
Hoping I can find my way to a better place now
Even when I'm feeling down, I fight
Even when I don't know what is right
I'ma pick a side, and I'ma take pride
I will decide my fate and I
Will never let them tell me who I am
If you try to shape me, I'll be damned
Planted on the ground is where I stand
Never give up, that was always the plan
It's so cold outside
I'm alone, I'm alright
It's so cold outside
I'm alone, I'm alright

I don't get what I want
I get what I need
Every single day Im heading off to my dream
And I get everything
That I damn well please
I don't give a damn if you all listenin to me
Cuz I run it...
I'm the only one that really want it
I'm the only one thats really on it
I'm just being honest
I'm just doing everything I promised
Cuz I want it bad enough that Ima make it as an artist
And I know I'm not the smartest and I know I'm not the largest but I promise you that Ima be the one to work the hardest
Cuz I promise you I'm just getting started
And I promise you that my skills are getting sharper
So ima get charted
Can't be guarded na
I'm the one to get retarded
Get the party started yea

So let me get up on it yea

Bitch you got me fucked up
I don't know what's up
Pour that shit in my cup
We bout to turn up
Crank this shit up so loud
Sounds like we're sold out
In front of a whole crowd
We lose control now
Y'all take this shit to personally
Everybody got a different version of me
Everybody got to be learning from me
Everybody wanna be working with me
And I feel like there's uncertainty
And urgency to find out what you want to be
But honestly we change our minds constantly
So stop and breathe to find out who you want to be


Failure ain't an option
So I'd be cautious
I hope that your watching
Don't try to stop this
Work until I'm nauseous
Cuz I will not quit
No because I want this
Don't try to stop me now

It's too late for you
Not for me
I don't give a fuck if you got a college degree
Did u learn anything really worth anything?
$200 grand later and were not even working
Student loans worth more than what were earning
Best lesson I learned is to keep on searching
Find your true passion and get to working
Better take action or you'll end up serving
Yeah
That's a fact
So you better clean up your act
So you better grow yourself a sack
And tell the world they can suck on that
Don't come back
Back your bags
Ya take a trip
And don't relax
Ya hit the switch
And just attack
Ya find your niche
And make some racks
Don't hold back
Everybody wake up
It's time to break up
With the life you made up
It's time to trade up
Live the life you want now
A life you don't doubt
I could give a fuck how
Just figure it out
Wake up, wake up
Man this life is a blur
Everyone's got an opinion so which one you prefer?
Cuz I'll give you one that's coming from an entrepreneur
Don't give up on your dream if it's what you deserve
(Yeah)


Failure ain't an option
So I'd be cautious
I hope that your watching
Don't try to stop this
Work until I'm nauseous
Cuz I will not quit
No because I want this
Don't try to stop me now


Failure ain't an option

Yeah, yeah, let's go

I ain't the first with the curse, with the thirst
That I wanna be better, not worse, man, it hurts
I'm on this earth with my words
And I put 'em all together, insert, 'cause I wanna have worth
Working hella hard, till they put me in the dirt
Gonna go far, man, listen to my words
Gonna be a star, man, life's like a blur
When you're working this hard, yeah, you get what you deserve (Let's go)
Yeah, I ain't taking a back seat

They gasping, they cannot compare, they can't match me
I'm at half speed, I got your girl and she laughing
And dancing, hanging on my what? She asking to crash with me
Smash with me, she savagely
Wants cash money and she knows that I live lavishly, uh

I wanna live
I'm cold inside
Give all I have
Just to feel alive
I fight to live
I fight to strive
One day I'll have
What I want in life
I want the whole world in the palm of my hand, I got a plan
I'm the man, now I'm teaching the game, a veteran, better than
Anybody else who test me
I'm ready, looking at my hand and it's steady
I'm trending, ascending and blending
Lyrical bending, now I'm spreading and getting
My name out now, yeah, they hearing me loud
All the crowds rapping the sound, I'm hitting the ground
Running, up and coming, ain't nothing, yeah
Rookie of the year, I'ma keep it one hundred
Cold blooded, no budget, from nothing
To something, nah, I ain't bluffing
I got a full hand and a full plan
I ain't gonna stop till I'm at the top, man
Every single drop got me feeling awesome
I'm about to pop, started from the bottom, yeah
