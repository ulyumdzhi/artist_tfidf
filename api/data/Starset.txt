Mayday! Mayday!
This ship is slowly sinking
They think I'm crazy but they don't know the feeling
They're all around me
Circling like vultures
They wanna break me and wash away my colors
Wash away my colors

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
(''Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
(Way, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons

I cannot stop this sickness taking over
It takes control and drags me into nowhere
I need your help, I can't fight this forever
I know you're watching
I can feel you out there
Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
(Way, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons

Take me over the walls below
Fly forever
Don't let me go
I need a savior to heal my pain
When I become my worst enemy
The enemy

Take me high and I'll sing
You make everything okay
We are one and the same
You take all of the pain away

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
(Way, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons
Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
(Way, away, away)
Save me if I become

Under the knife I surrendered
The innocence yours to consume
You cut it away
And you filled me up with hate
Into the silence you sent me
Into the fire consumed
You thought I’d forget
But it’s always in my head

You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
You're the love that I hate
You're the drug that I take
Will you cage me?
Will you cage me?
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
From the monster you made me?
The monster you made me?
This is the world you've created
The product of what I've become
My soul and my youth
Seems it's all for you to use
If I could take back the moment
I let you get under my skin
Relent or resist?
Seems the monster always wins

You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
You're the love that I hate
You're the drug that I take
Will you cage me?
Will you cage me?
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
From the monster you made me?
The monster you made me?
My heart's an artifice, a decoy soul
I'll lift you up and then I'll let you go
I've made an art of digging shallow holes
I drop the darkness in and watch it grow
My heart's an artifice, a decoy soul
Who knew the emptiness could be so cold?
I've lost the parts of me that make me whole
I am the darkness
I'm a monster

You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
You're the love that I hate
You're the drug that I take
Will you cage me?
Will you cage me?
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
From the monster you made me?
The monster you made me?
The monster you made me?
The monster you made me?24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
And we were bold
Over the world
We were flying through the satellites
We had ahold
Of the lightning strikes
When we should have been afraid of heights
And I was trying just to get you
And now I'm dying to forget you
'Cause I knew I couldn't catch you
So I left the sky
And I fell behind

We were one and the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
We were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

If I was whole
I'd turn right now
I'd forget it and just walk away
'Cause I've been told
That I'm dragging it out
But I've been dying just to see your face
And all I wanted was to say "goodbye"
Into the fortress that you're stuck behind
And in the silence now I realize
That after all I built the wall
We were one and the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
You were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

All these broken souls
They never make me whole
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart
All these broken souls
Each one more beautiful
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart
I'll send out my soul
To worlds more beautiful
But they won't, they won't know my heart
It's the darkest part

We were one and the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
You were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made

Fall in and fall away
This love is in retrograde
Fall in and fall away
I can see the darkness
Manifest

Gravity
I pull on you
Close enough to rendezvous
You come to me and then you slip right through
I'm in the solitude
Why's it always touch and go?
Now we'll never even know what it's like
Left me in the afterglow
'Til I'm falling through space and time

Starlight, star bright
You got your missiles flying through the air tonight
And it's alright‚ alright
I think I'm getting used to the firefight

'Cause you fall in and fall away
This love is in retrograde
Fall in and fall away
I kinda think you like this
Regress
Fall in and fall away
There's something in the hate we make
Fall in and fall away
I can see the darkness
Manifest
Every time I'm onto you
You change it up‚ you always do
So tell me why you gotta bring your guns?
It's Armageddon
This is always touch and go
Now we'll never even know what it's like
Left me with no place to go
Now I'm falling through space and time
(Time)

Starlight‚ star bright
Every night you're dimmer, have you finally fell?
You said it's alright, alright
But I've been getting ready for a bombshell

'Cause you fall in and fall away
This love is in retrograde
Fall in and fall away
I kinda think you like this
Regress
Fall in and fall away
There's something in the hate we make
Fall in and fall away
I can see the darkness
Is my fate silver-lined?
I always was the optimist
But I never thought of this
Stuck in this state‚ misaligned
Trapped inside the looking glass
Tell me when will all this pass
Oh, how I hate the silver line
Never could taste your life
Never my place and time
Left behind
Never your state of mind
Never in phase with mine

'Cause you fall in and fall away
This love is in retrograde
Fall in and fall away
I kinda think you like this
Regress
Fall in and fall away
There's something in the hate we make
Fall in and fall away
I can see the darkness

I will run alone tonight
Without you by my side
I guess you had a place you had to get to
I know your eyes
I know inside
The walls you hide behind
And I saw the truth inside the real you

Because I know you're lost when you run away
Into the same black holes and black mistakes
Taking all my will just to run alone
When are you coming home?

Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
There's no pain that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you
And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no thing that I won’t go through
Even if I have to die for you

One day the Earth will open wide
And I’ll follow you inside
'Cause the only hell I know is without you
Some day when galaxies collide
We'll be lost on different skies
I will send my rocket ship to find you
Because I know you're lost when you run away
Into the same black holes and black mistakes
Taking all my will just to run alone
Until I bring you home

Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
There's no pain that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you
And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no thing that I won’t go through
Even if I have to die for you

And if the sun grows cold for you along the way
And if the stars don’t line to light the way
And when you fall away and crash back down below
I’ll search the skies for you and I’ll follow
I'll be in your afterglow
And I’ll bring you home

Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
I can't see but I'll follow you
Even if I'd die
And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no thing that I won’t go through
Even if I have to die for you11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Even a well lit place, can hide salvation
A map to a one man maze that never sees the sun
Where the lost are the heroes
And the thieves are left to drown
But everyone knows by now
Fairy-tales are not found
They are written in the walls

As we walk in a straight line
Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
But nothing could ever stop us
From stealing our own place in the sun
We will face the odds against us
And run into the fear we run from (ah, ah)
It has begun

Into the dark below
Evading shadows
Blind in a rabbit's hole
We fall beneath the earth
And watch the shell come unraveled
As the seed begins to rise
Embracing a starlit fate as we wait in the night
It's written in the walls
As we walk in a straight line
Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
But nothing could ever stop us
From stealing our own place in the sun
We will face the odds against us
And run into the fear we run from (ah, ah)

It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Stardust
In you and in me
Fuse us
Into unity
Primeval
We're coupled
Born from the universe
Farewell
The void is calling
Don't fear
For futures and dreams
They're fleeting, retreating
It's ok. I promise

I don't know what to say
But I'm going to want you till the stars evaporate
We're only here for just a moment in the light
One day it shines for us the next we're in the night
So say the word and I'll be running back to find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight
Of your starlight
Tell me
Just tell me to stay
I'll turn
I won't look away
I'll stay here
I'll never go but you don't feel the same
Farewell
Farewell and godspeed
Light years
Between you and me
I'm fading
Your beauty conquers the darkness

At night the earth will rise
And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies
Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite
I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light
And I'll fall in love with you again
I will find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight of your starlight

Don't leave me lost here forever
Show me your starlight and pull me through
Don't leave me lost here forever
I need your starlight and pull me through
Bring me back to you
At night the earth will rise
And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies
Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite
I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light
And I'll fall in love with you again
I will find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight of your starlight9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Darkening skies, coming this way
Falling behind, into nothing

But if you lead, I'll follow
A thousand miles away
I will be your Apollo
Alone in outer space

Satellite, shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity, I will stay and never leave
My satellite, are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me
Shine on me

Blinded I wait, the end is forming
You are my fate, give me warning

If you lead, I'll follow
A thousand miles away
I will be your Apollo
Alone in ou—
Satellite, shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity, I will stay and never leave
My satellite, are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me
Shine on me

Far across the emptiness I walk the night
And search the silence in the dark you left behind
I seek the stars above worlds to be the guides
But they all pale against the light in your eyes
In your eyes...
And I won't suppose to know why you walked away
But I can feel you pushing through beyond the space
So send your energy to me and I'll push through
Send your signal home and bring me back to you

Satellite, shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity, I will stay and never leave
My satellite, are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me
Shine on me2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Prepare the diving bell
It's time to take this low again
I sink into myself, low
No need for farewell
I know you always understand

Sorry there's no place for you inside the solitude
Just stay up here until I'm back again
I swear I'll be there for you
I swear I'll follow through
Stay the course and keep the ship manned

I was certain if I fell through the bottom
You'd be happy just to float here on your own
I was never quite prepared for the long ride, oh
Away, away, away, alone

Oh, this wasn't in my plans
Abandoned ship and heading for the sand
Oh, the albatross crash-lands
I've got the sinking feeling that I never can go home
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
Prepare the diving bell
Maybe just for a spell, again
As far as I can tell
Oh, you knew me too well
I miss you there when I descend

Sorry, there's no place for you inside the solitude
Just stay up here until I'm back again

Oh, this wasn't in my plans
Abandoned ship and heading for the sand
Oh, the albatross crash-lands
I've got the sinking feeling that I never can go home
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?

In my mind, endless sea
Calling from the bottom, but you don't hear me
Send your line down to me
Meet me on the surface
I will never leave
In my mind, endless sea
Calling from the bottom, but you don't hear me
Send your line down to me
Meet me on the surface
I will never leave
Just one time, all I need
Calling from the bottom but you don't hear me
Stuck in time, stuck in me
Broken on the bottom like a refugee
Wake me when the new day comes
Together we will ride the sun
The future is an empty gun
We ride on to them one-by-one
Wake me when the new day comes
Together we will ride the sun
The future is an empty gun
We ride on to them one-by-one
Wake me when the new day comes
Together we will ride the sun
The future is an empty gun
We ride on to them one-by-one
One-by-one5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
And if I had my way
I would run to the rescue
It never works that way
When you call a bluff
Oh, all the fools rush in
It's a battle to surround you
And all the fools want in
But I'm not giving up

I don't wanna let you go
But I can't stand to watch this
I don't wanna let you know
But you can read my mind

I feel it all the time
Felt it all around you
You had me under spell right from the start
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic
Blind, I fall into the line
That's waiting just to get you
But I don't ever know just what we are
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic
Look inside my brain
You know what I want before I tell you
Give me the words to say to make it enough
Don't want your star-crossed fate
You are the sun, I am the full moon
Don't leave me lost in vain
I can be what you want

I don't wanna let you go
But I can't stand to watch this
I don't wanna let you know
But you can read my mind

I feel it all the time
Felt it all around you
You had me under spell right from the start
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic
Blind, I fall into the line
That's waiting just to get you
But I don't ever know just what we are
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic
Telepathic
Telepathic
And you always turn away
Back to the start where I break through
You can run, you can run away
I will wait in the dark for you
Should've never fell this way
Cause you're the sun and I'm just a moon
I'm in the dark 'till you light the way
Cause I'm see through
You can read my mind

I feel it all the time
Felt it all around you
You had me under spell right from the start
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic
Blind, I fall into the line
That's waiting just to get you
But I don't ever know just what we are
I don't have a telepathic heart
