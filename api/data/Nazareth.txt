Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and marks
Any heart
Not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts

I'm young, I know, but even so
I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
They're not foolin' me
I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts


I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts
Ooh, ooh...8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"Look out the left," the captain said
"The lights down there, that's where we'll land"
Saw a falling star burning
High above the Las Vegas sand
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailers
Not the early one that you wish upon
Not the northern one that guides in the sailors
You've got that touch so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so cryptical
Can't talk to you babe, you know I get so weak
Sometimes I think that love is just mythical
Up there's a heaven, down there's a town
Blackness everywhere any little lights shine
Blackness, blackness draggin' me down
Come on light a candle in this heart of mine
Starbright, starbright, you've got the lovin' that I like
Turn this crazy bird around
Should not have got on this flight tonight
I'm drinkin' sweet champagne, got the headphones up high
Can't numb you, can't drum you out of my mind
They're singin', "Goodbye baby
Baby bye-bye
Ooh! Love is blind"
Up go the flaps, down go the wheels
Hope you got your heat turned on, baby
Hope they've finally fixed your automobile
Hope it's better when we meet again, babe
Starbright, starbright, you've got the lovin' that I like
Turn this crazy bird around
Should not have got on this flight tonight
Should not have got on this flight tonightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Every single day
I think of the times
When you were still mine
And I'm blue
Got to get away
Get you out of my mind
I'm caught up in time
And I'm blue
I don't miss all the fun that we had
You were always around me
Where are you now
I need you now
If you were around
It would be alright
Living on my own
I know I'm to blame
I'm locked in my chains
And you're free
Fallen like a stone
I'm down on the ground
I'm tied up and bound
And you're free
I don't miss all the fun that we had
You were always around me
Where are you now
I need you now
If you were around it would be alright
Where are you now
I need you now
If you were around it would be alright
Where are you now
I need you now
If you were around it would be alrightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Dream on
Though it's hard to tell
Though you're fooling yourself, dream on
Dream on
You can hide away
There's nothin' to say, so dream on
Dream on
Though it's hard to tell
Though you're fooling yourself, dream on
You can laugh at me because I'm crying
You can tell your friends how much I begged you to stay
You can live your fantasy without me
But you'll never know how much I needed you
Dream on
It's so easy for you
Though I'm broken in two, dream on
Dream on
You can never see
What you're doing to me, so dream on
You can cross your heart and still be lying
You can count the reasons why you've thrown it away
You can dream your life away without me
But you'll never know how much I needed you
You can laugh at me because I'm crying
You can tell your friends how much I begged you to stay
You can live your fantasy without me
But you'll never know how much I needed you
Dream on
It's so easy for you
Though I'm broken in two, dream on
Dream on
You can never see
What you're doing to me, so dream on
Dream on
Though it's hard to tell
Though you're fooling yourself, dream on

I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
Said I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
Come take me to your house
Then I'm gonna rip you off
Well, I made my first kill
With the old town girl
She was the apple of her daddy's eye
Well, that woman looked up at me
And I said, "Honey we'll be
Together 'til the day I die"
But I lied
I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
Come take me to your house
Then I'm gonna rip you off
There seems to be no end
Of women who are lookin' for a man
My services don't come cheap
But I help out when I can
Tell them lies that they wanna hear
And I really lead 'em on
Spend all of their money
And I'm long gone
I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
Come take me to your house
Then I'm gonna rip you off
I've got tastes for fast cars
I don't wanna settle down
The good life sure comes easily
With all the mugs around
The women they just come to me
I don't have to look around
I move into their homes with them
Then I move on
I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
I'm a bad, bad boy
I'm gonna steal your love
Come take me to your house
Then I'm gonna rip you off
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad
I'm such a, such a bad, bad boy
I'm gonna rip you off
Just take control of your mind
I'm a bad, bad boy
I'm gonna steal your love
I'm a bad, bad boy
I'm gonna steal your love
I'm gonna rip you off
Just take control of the time
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
You know, I'm a bad boy
I'm so bad...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sunshine, every single day
Helps to light my way
And darlin', right before my eyes
It don't come as no surprise
That it's easy, easy loving you
And baby, 'til you came along
There was always something wrong around me
There was emptiness, of course
But it's alright
And it's easy, easy loving you
And sunshine, having you around
You're the light I never found
And darlin', every minute you're away
But it's brighter
And it's easy, easy loving youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Please don't Judas me
Treat me, as you'd like to be treated
Please don't blacklist me
Leave me, as you'd wish to find me
Don't analyse me
Sacrifice me
Please don't Judas me
Please don't chastise me
Show me just one shred of kindness
Try to help me see
Guide me in my eyes of blindness
Don't despise me
Categorise me
Please don't Judas me
No, no, don't Judas me
No, please don't Judas me
Please don't headshrink me
Don't disguise your innuendos
Give no lies to me
I can see the way the wind blows
Don't debase me
Annihilate me
Please don't Judas me
Please don't number me
Don't betray my trust and promise
Please don't anger me
I find it hard to bear no malice
Don't frustrate me
Manipulate me
Please don't Judas me
No, no, don't Judas me
No, please don't Judas me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Since you came into my life
It's the same old situation
Empty days and lonely nights
Filled with bitterness and frustration
Walking lonely in the cold
Trying to find the answer
Spend my money on a crystal ball
And the charms of a gypsy dancer
Trying to break the spell you hold on me
Chorus:
You're miss misery
That song you lay on me
Set me free, set me free
Please, please, please
Every day is filled with shame
My nights are filled with anger
Hollow lies, forced denial
If you told the truth I can't remember
You know, I've got to find my way
Got to find a reason
Got to find your weakness
So I can end your witchin' season
Got to break this spell you hold on me
Chorus:
Lead
Can't think how I got myself
Caught up in this nightmare
Evil schemes, midnight screams
Come on somebody listen to my prayer
I'd give all I've got to give
Just to find my way out
Got it goin' but I can't let go
I'm trapped on this crazy roundabout
Tryin' to break this spell you hold on me
Chorus:EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Close up the bar you know the gates of the brewery
She's out there every night
And she sure ain't drinkin' tea
I love that woman, she's the best one that I had
But she's got this habit now and it sure is gettin' bad
That whiskey drinkin' woman
Is makin' a poor man out of me
She's got bottles in the kitchen
Even got them in my bed
Most times I see her now
She's three parts out of her head
Don't know where I went wrong
I sure try to treat her right
But it sure upsets me
Seein' her juiced up every night
That whiskey drinkin' woman
Is makin' a poor man out of me
Got to solve this problem
Won't you help me find the key
The way that things are going
I'll have to buy the distillery
She just stands there smilin'
With a whiskey in each hand
Got to think of something
Don't know how much I can stand
That whiskey drinkin' woman
Is makin' a poor man out of me
Got to get myself together, start workin' something out
Maybe if I tried some booze, I'd know what it's about
I love that woman, she's the best one that I had
But she's got this problem now
And it sure is gettin' bad
That whiskey drinkin' woman
Is makin' a poor man out of meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
