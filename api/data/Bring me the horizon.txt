Do you wanna start a cult with me?
I'm not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we're gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell "epiphany"?

Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Yeah!

Could I have your attention, please?
It's time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe

Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Oh!45EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?

Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown

What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?
Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown

'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
('Cause you know that I can't do this on my)

Who will fix me now?
Who will fix me now?
Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?

I've got a fever, don't breathe on me
I'm a believer in nobody
Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something
Hope I don't sneeze, I don't *sneeze*
Really we just need to fear something
Only pretending to feel something
I know you're dying to run
I wanna turn you around

Please remain calm
The end has arrived
We cannot save you
Enjoy the ride
This is the moment
You've been waiting for
Don't call it a warning
This is a war
It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, ayy, ayy
Move

I heard they need better signal
Put chip and pins in the needles
Quarantine all of those secrets
In that black hole you call a brain before it's too late
Really we just wanna scream something
Only pretend to believe something
I know you're baying for blood
I wanna turn you around (Hey)

Please remain calm (Hey)
The end has arrived (Hey)
We cannot save you (Hey)

Something else will

You can board up your windows
You can lock up your doors, yeah
But you can't keep washing your hands
Of this shit anymore
When all the king's sources and all the king's friends
Don't know their arses from their pathogens
When life is a prison and death is the door
This ain't a warning
This is a war, war
This is a war, ayy, ayy, oh, oh
It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy

Some resist the future, some refuse the past
Either way, it's messed up if we can't unplug the fact
That a world covered in cables was never wired to last
So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash

(How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
You're like a phantom greeting me
We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows
Stuck in a loop for eternity

Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass
But names can dig so many graves, you won't know where to stand
And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed
And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a show

S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it, let's go!

I've had enough
There's a voice in my head, says I'm better off dead
But if I sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, I'll be alright
You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, you'll be just fine, 'cause…

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles

S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it
We are possessed
We're all fucked in the head, alone and depressed
But if we sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, maybe we'll forget, 'cause…

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles
Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming
'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles

The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So let's all sing along a little goddamn louder
To a happy song and pretend it's all okay (Let's go)
So let's sing along
Let's sing along
A little fucking louder
A little fucking louder
Well, don't you feel so much better?
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it (Well, that's the spirit)
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it (Yeah, that's the spirit)96EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost
I need to feel something, 'cause I'm still so far from home
Cross your heart and hope to die
Promise me you'll never leave my side
Show me what I can't see when the spark in my eyes is gone
You got me on my knees, I'm your one-man cult
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise you I'll never leave your side

'Cause I'm telling you, you're all I need
I promise you, you're all I see
'Cause I'm telling you, you're all I need
I'll never leave

So, you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you

Come sink into me and let me breathe you in
I'll be your gravity, you be my oxygen
So dig two graves, 'cause when you die
I swear I'll be leaving by your side
So you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you so you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you
I will follow you, I will follow you


So you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you51EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sometimes I wonder why are we all here
Call me a nihilist, I guess I'm just unclear
To why I bother, why I try
Death is on my mind so much, it makes me wanna die
I lost my wife this year, we've lost our friend
Always fighting battles, but it never seem to end
Are we just ladders in the world of snakes?
'Cause if life's one big fuckin' game, well, I don't wanna play
So come and sing me, sing me to sleep
I dealt with too much fuckin' shit and now I'm in too deep
Cut off my wings, my flowers bloomed
You want salvation? Well, I'm sorry, we're all doomed

Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires, so here
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my
The world's a funeral, a room of ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
They kicked the chair, but we
We helped tie the rope
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back

You must've made some kind of mistake
I asked for death, but instead, I'm awake
The Devil told me, "No room for cheats"
I thought I'd sold my soul, but he kept the receipt
So leave a light on, I'm coming home
It's getting darker, but I'll carry on
The sun don't shine but it never did
And when it rains, it fuckin' pours, but I think I like it
And you know that I'm in love with the mess, I think I like it

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back

Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?
(Can you feel my heart?)

Can you help the hopeless? Well, I'm begging on my knees
Can you save my bastard soul, will you wait for me?
I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover
Forgive me, father, I love you, mother

I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know (Know)
I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know

Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne82EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
You rained on my heart for far too long (Far too long)
Couldn't see the thunder for the storm
Because I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud
I don't know why I tried to save you 'cause
I can't save you from yourself
When all you give a shit about is everybody else

And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

You need a taste of your own medicine
'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing
Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
So I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit

Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
And I spent too long in a place I don't belong
I couldn't see the thunder for the storm
But you won't admit, why don't you get a grip?
'Cause you can't keep going on and on and on and on like this
And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

You need a taste of your own medicine
'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing
Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
So I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit
