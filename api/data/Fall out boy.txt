Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you
Anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart
And break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping
For the wrong team
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching
You two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart
And break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping
For the wrong team

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down (down, down)
Down, down (down, down)
We're going down, down (down, down)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself)

Du du du du-du du du
Du du du du du-du du du

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries352EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head

The stench, the stench of summer sex
And CK Eternity - oh Hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart136EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm going to make it bend and break
(It sent you to me without wings...) Say a prayer, but let the
Good times roll, in case God doesn't show
(Let the good times roll, let the good times roll...)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?" If that's the worst you've got
Better put your fingers back to the keys...

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter"

Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal
Ball...
It's always cloudy except for (Except for...)
When you look into the past (Look into the past...)
One night stand...
One night stand off!
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter"

They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter," whoa
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you

Only sweeter"

They say we are what we are, but we don’t have to be
I’m bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I’ll be the watcher (watcher) of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams

Oh, I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass, glass, glass
Oh, I try to picture me without you, but I can’t

'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long

We could be immor—immortals, immor—immortals
Immor—immortals, immor—immortals, immortals

Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again every day
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound, but they’re my sutures
Oh, I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass, glass, glass
Oh, I try to picture me without you, but I can’t

Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long

We could be immor—immortals, immor—immortals, immortals

And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down

We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long

We could be immor—immortals, immor—immortals

I was just an only child of the universe
And then I found you, and then I found you
You are the sun and I am just the planets
Spinning around you, spinning around you
You were too good to be true, gold plated
But what's inside you? But what's inside you?
I know this whole damn city thinks it needs you
But not as much as I do, as much as I do, yeah

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
I am a collapsing star with tunnel vision
But only for you, but only for you
My head is stripped, just like a screw that's been tightened too many times
When I think of you, when I think of you
I will shield you from the waves if they find you
I will protect you, I will protect you
Just tell me, tell me, tell me I, I am the only one
Even if it's not true, even if it's not true, yeah

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete

I'm here, at the beginning of the end
Oh, the end of infinity with you
I'm here, at the beginning of the end
Oh, the end of infinity with you
I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
Oh, you drain all the fear from me
I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
You drain the fear from me

Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out the cage, I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

But my songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up

Well all the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
Through a constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up

She says she's no good
With words, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too
Overdramatic
Tonight, it's "it can't get much worse"
Versus "No one should ever feel like..."

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by (...emal si namhorT eoJ)

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

You always fold just
Before you're found out
Drink up, it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake, and I
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love me (Way they'd love)

I think I got too many memories getting in the way of me
I'm 'bout to go Tonya Harding on the whole world's knee
And I'm stuck, night vision, so stuck, night vision
But I come to life, come to life

Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve, are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit? Eau de résistance

The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah

Seems like the whole damn world went and lost its mind
And all my childhood heroes have fallen off or died
Fake tears, real living, fake tears
But the alcohol never lies, never lies

Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve, are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit? Eau de résistance
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!

Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

Sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright100EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
