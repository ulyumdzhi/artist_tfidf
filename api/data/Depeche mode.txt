Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm


Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm


Enjoy the silence49EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

Feeling unknown and you're all alone
Flesh and bone by the telephone
Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer
Take second best, put me to the test
Things on your chest you need to confess
I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith

You've been kept down
You've been pushed 'round
You've been lied to
You've been fed truths
Who's making your decisions?
You or your religion
Your government, your countries
You patriotic junkies

Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down
Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down

You've been pissed on
For too long
Your rights abused
Your views refused
They manipulate and threaten
With terror as a weapon
Scare you till you're stupefied
Wear you down until you're on their side
Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down
Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down

You had something to hide
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you?
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through

It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth

Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth

Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Now you're standing there tongue-tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell

You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before


Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore

There'll be times when my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable

But when you think I've had enough from your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?

Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again and will you return it?

There'll be days when I'll stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn when you've got something to teach
Oh, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I won't say it again

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?
Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?
Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?
I give in
Again and again
I give in
Will you give it to me?
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in
I give in
Again and again
I give in
That's how my love goes
I give in
I'll say it again

When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter, it's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
You're like an angel and you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of


I just can't get enough

I'm taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where he's taking me
Taking me where I want to be
I'm taking a ride with my best friend

We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground

I'm taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me I'm as safe as houses
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again

We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
Never let me down
Never let me down
Never let me down
Never let me down

See the stars, they're shining bright
(Never let me down)
Everything's alright tonight
(Never let me down)
See the stars, they're shining bright
(Never let me down)
Everything's alright tonight
(Never let me down)
See the stars, they're shining bright
(Never let me down)
Everything's alright tonight
(Never let me down)
See the stars, they're shining bright

Everything's alright tonight

I was born with the wrong sign
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road
That led to the wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique

There's something wrong with me chemically
Something wrong with me inherently
The wrong mix in the wrong genes
I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means
It was the wrong plan in the wrong hands
With the wrong theory for the wrong man
The wrong eyes on the wrong prize
The wrong questions with the wrong replies

I was marching to the wrong drum
With the wrong scum
Pissing out the wrong energy
Using all the wrong lines
And the wrong signs
With the wrong intensity
I was on the wrong page of the wrong book
With the wrong rendition of the wrong hook
Made the wrong move every wrong night
With the wrong tune played 'til it sounded right yeah

I've felt better
I've been up all night
I can feel it coming
The morning light
The air is so cold here
It's so hard to breathe
We better take cover
Will you cover me?

Way up here with the Northern lights
Beyond you and me
I dreamt of us in another life
One we've never reached

You know we're sinking
We could fade away
I'm not going down
Not today
The air is so cold here
Too cold to see
We have to take cover
Cover me
Way up here with the Northern lights
Beyond these broken bars
I pictured us in another life
Where we're all super stars2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Precious and fragile things
Need special handling
My God, what have we done to you?
We always tried to share
The tenderest of care
Now look what we have put you through

Things get damaged, things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

Angels with silver wings
Shouldn't know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you
If God has a master plan
That only He understands
I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through

Things get damaged, things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

I pray you learn to trust
Have faith in both of us
And keep room in your hearts for two

Things get damaged, things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
