Ha!

Now listen closely

Here's a little lesson in trickery
This is going down in history
If you wanna be a Villain Number One
You have to chase a superhero on the run

Just follow my moves, and sneak around
Be careful not to make a sound
BLYAT!

We are number one! (Hey!)

Now look at this net, that I just found
When I say go, be ready to throw
Go!

Let's try something else

Now watch and learn, here's the deal
He'll slip and slide on this banana peel!
Ha-ha-ha- oh!
What are you doing!?

(Hey!)

We are number one!
Da da da-da-da-da-da da da, da da da da da da da
We are number one! (Hey!)

WE ARE NUMBER ONE!
We are number one! (Hey!)
We are number one! (Hey!)

We are number one!
We are number one!
We are number one! (Hey! Hey!)
 
Execution’s fun
I think that you should come
To loose yourself and to relax
Just put your head under my axe
Execution’s fun
I think you should try one
To put your mind back on track
I’ll swing my axe right through your neck
Execution’s fun
And now the pain is gone
You will live forever after
And you’ll give us a little laughter
Execution’s fun
It’s not for everyone
All your records must be clean
And you must be at least eighteen
Bring me, bring me volunteers
Bring them, bring them, let me see
Help me, help me put my hood on
Hand my giant axe to me
Help me, help me, help me stand up
Raise me, raise me to my feet
Help me, help me, help me swing it
Execution is complete!
Execution’s fast
A moment that will last
Think of joy that you will bring
You’ll entertain your dear king
Chains are not free
So plan accordingly
Feel the fangs of open market
We now have PR department
Bring me, bring me volunteers
Bring them, bring them, let me see
Help me, help me put my hood on
Hand my giant axe to me
Help me, help me, help me stand up
Raise me, raise me to my feet
Help me, help me, help me swing it
Execution is complete!
King is crazy, King is mad
Ruling from the deathbed
He enjoys his bed and cushions
And the morning executions
King is crazy, King is mad
King wants just to see you dead
Life if just a bad illusion
Try my permanent solution
All prisoners are dead
So we take you instead
It is a show to see
So bring your family
Executions fun
Oh god, what have I done...
Bring me, bring me volunteers
Bring them, bring them, let me see
Help me, help me put my hood on
Hand my giant axe to me
Help me, help me, help me stand up
Raise me, raise me to my feet
Help me, help me, help me swing it
Execution is complete!
Bring me, bring me volunteers
Bring them, bring them, let me see
Help me, help me put my hood on
Hand my giant axe to me
Help me, help me, help me stand up
Raise me, raise me to my feet
Help me, help me, help me swing it
Execution is complete!
 
A human mind - a fragile thing
Its walls are weaker than you think
You lock your door, you think you’re safe
And all the people think the same
No mind is ever locked for me
My voice is now my masterkey
I open doors, I crack the codes
And put a spell
And there is nothing you can hide
I’m in control once I’m inside
You’re just a vessel for my will
An empty shell
I am a scholar, my mentor is
A wise and famous hypnotist
I feel the power, the magic force
Just like in his online course
This is the perfect place and time
To commit a perfect crime
You’d better not try to resist
Enjoy the ride
No one around, the time is right
So let me step into the light
It only takes a magic phrase
To break your mind
Hypnotize, hypnotize, watch the spirals in my eyes
Hypnotize, hypnotize, mesmerise
Hypnotize, hypnotize, play along and play it nice
Hypnotize, hypnotize, look into my eyes
It should be working, I know it is
Or I am not a hypnotist!
I have a plan, you’ve got a role
I put you on remote control
Stop giving me a silly stare
Now go away like you don't care
I know a spell, I know how to
Set you ablaze
For now consider yourself free
I have a night ahead of me
And you won’t be the last to hear
My magic phrase
Hypnotize, hypnotize, watch the spirals in my eyes
Hypnotize, hypnotize, mesmerise
Hypnotize, hypnotize, play along and play it nice
Hypnotize, hypnotize, look into my eyes
Two days have passed, now I'm prepared
Nervous a bit, a little scared
I called for them, my slaves are here
I am the master! The puppeteer!
But I have no idea how
My mentor is their master now
They all have brands just like he has
Across his face
This is not right, this is not fair!
They are giving me a blinkless stare!
And chanting, chanting my beloved
Magic phrase
Hypnotize, hypnotize, watch the spirals in my eyes
Hypnotize, hypnotize, mesmerise
Hypnotize, hypnotize, play along and play it nice
Hypnotize, hypnotize, look into my eyes
 
The crowd is a monster, It’s drinking and laughing
It's loudly discussing Your age
But you are above it, You look like a goddess
When you come onto The stage
The crowd is violent, But it goes silent
It hungrily looks at Your skin
You heartbeat is loud. No one can put out
The flame that you’ve brought here Within
The showtime is over You rush past the crowd
You feel like you’ve been Torn apart
You lie in bed with A half-finished poem
Breathing inside in Your heart
I’m up in the attic A lonely fanatic
Your biggest admirer And fan
You´re smart and you know it, You’re more than a poet
And I’m even less than A man
Do you know that everybody
Is coming just to see your body
I am not like them at all
I am coming, I am coming...
I am coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
I am coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
For your little ugly soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul
A bar in the uptown, A detuned piano
I’m waiting for you Every day
All drunks and all patrons, All thieves and all beggars
Keep singing along when You play
You've got skill and passion, But you too old-fashioned
And you’ve got nothing To sell
It’s not you desire. Your biggest admirer -
A soul-sucking demon From hell
All of them are coming here
Just to drink a glass of beer
I am not like them at all
I am coming, I am coming...
I am coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
I am coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
For your little ugly soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul
Kiss your sorry skill goodbye
After I have sucked you dry
I belive that you will fail
Any minute
And I know it for a fact
There is no way you can act
Read your lines like you care
Like you mean it!
Fame and money are so sweet
Now you’ve got no soul to eat
I’m afraid that I misjudged
It’s importance
Have no worries, have no fear
At the peak of your career
I won't be the one to ruin
Your performance
I have seen that everywhere
You will die, no one will care
Let me just fulfill my role
I am coming, I am coming...
I am coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
I am coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul
For your soul, for your soul
For your little ugly soul
For your soul, for your soul
I’m coming for your soul
 
Life is not fair
People everywhere
Are spending years analyzing
A fictional affair
Think of global warming!
Help me spread the warning!
And forget about it
By tomorrow morning
You’ve got time to spare
Tell me, will you dare
To spend your life as a volunteer
So life could be fair?
And when you were younger
You didn't die of hunger!
Think of all the children starving -
An impressive number!
Tell me now how you sleep
Safe from bombs and falling fires
Will your world just die when
They pull out tubes and wires?
Your compassion is strong
It just goes and comes along
And the only way to end it -
Is to sing a dreadful song!
See the climate changing?
Feel the planet ageing?
Thinking that you'll die before it
Is so much engaging!
Life's not really fair
Feel all that despair
Just acknowledge all the horrors
Like you really care
Tell me now how you sleep
Safe from bombs and falling fires
Will your world just die when
They pull out tubes and wires?
Your compassion is strong
It just goes and comes along
And the only way to end it -
Is to sing a dreadful song!
Sing a very dreadful song...
Feel the dread and sing along...
Let me tell you how I sleep
Safe from bombs and falling fires
And my world will die when
They pull out tubes and wires
My compassion is strong
It just goes and comes along
I know how to calm it down -
I just write a dreadful song!
Sing with me a dreadful song!
Feel the dread and sing along!
 
Stretching, filing, against her skin
Blessed are those who are not kin
In sin, we breathe; in sex, we tie
Duct tape her legs to the red sky
Foolsome flesh allowances
The pansies raided the pantry of
Gabardine dreams, promiscuous
Delight, deny not the flavor
Custard dreams
Abusing, musing
Marmalade flesh
Naked spread am I, am I
Actors of the tragic phantom
Extend your legs to great Saturn
Brown table tops scream for cover
At the sight of your new lover
If today I die
And can't deny
The poison chosen
For tonight, tonight
Borrowed dreams, hollowed reveries
Metal pillows, pewter yellows
Furry roadkill, house on the hill
Pouring gravy on her thighs still
If today I die
And can't deny
The poison chosen
For tonight, tonight
 
Well, show me the way
To the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
Show me the way
To the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
For if we don't find
The next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you, I tell you
I tell you we must die
Oh, moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why
Well ,show me the way to the next pretty boy
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
Show me the way to the next little boy
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
For if we don't find
The next little boy
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you, I tell you
I tell you we must die
Oh, moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why
 
The crazy scientist AKA Genius
Is carrying a bucket of ice
He has spent his last years back in his warehouse
Building a doomsday device
It's rusty and noisy, it sparks and it's smoking 
And powered by an exercise bike
All the equipment is turned to eleven
Waiting for the lightning to strike
I truly am a genius
I am the mastermind
With my machines I'll bring you to your knees
I will rule over mankind
The gears are turning and the hamsters are running
Powering deathmetal rays
It's storming and raining, but there is no lightning
And there will be no storms in days
Bored and distracted, he breaks it all down
Just like he did in the past
It's time to move on, to build a new one
Right in the place of the last
I truly am a genius
I am the mastermind
With my machines I'll bring you to your knees
I will rule over mankind
His tools are all broken, and warehouse is silent
He is crying, collapsed on a floor
“What is the point of a doomsday device
I don't want to rule anymore “
But there is one final and adequate challenge
For a brilliant mind in his prime
With the power of science, the one mastermind
Is traveling backwards in time
A crazy scientist AKA Genius
Is carrying a bucket of ice
The beer is cold. He, lo and behold
Won’t make the same mistake twice
Forget all the deathrays and world domination
He is studying the game of chess!
The world will be safe while he is playing
With various degrees of success
I truly am a genius
I am the mastermind
I have just began, and after I’m done
You will find this world redefined
 
Don’t you cry and don’t you worry
I will put on clown dress
I will sing and tell a story
I will help you with your stress
Have no fear whatsoever
Promise that you will be nice
But I beg you, don’t you ever
Look into my lifeless eyes
I signed up for clown care
Thinking that it’s just a game
But I’ve seen so much despair
That I’ll never be the same
Loss of limbs and brain cancer
Burning, countless degrees
Tell me if there is an answer?
Why they all deserve all this?
Little angel shaved my head
Drew fibrosis on my skin
Hello children, god is dead
Let the clown therapy begin
It can not be nature’s lesson -
Cancer at the age of ten
I will have to put my dress on
I will have to smile again
Little angel hold my lips
As I’m frowning upside-down
You do not deserve all this
Oh, don’t listen to that silly clown
Little angel shaved my head
Drew fibrosis on my skin
Hello children, god is dead
Let the clown therapy begin
 
Hello, hello, my darlings
Ain’t that a lovely sight?
Roll up and gather round
We have a show for you
TONIGHT!
To all who in a back rows -
You want to die of age?
There sure will be a chance, now
Come closer to stage
And DANCE!
There is a cavern where
The King of Maggots lies
A granter of all wishes
A devil in disguise
When tardigrades were fragile
A lonely tardigrade
Came to the King of Maggots
To wish and was betrayed
You want to live forever
No death, no agony
This is beyond my power
Can’t fool the entropy
But I can make you stronger
Impossible to kill
Immune to heat and hunger
A gesture of goodwill
A wicked catch embedded
In this demonic spell
A body dies and after
A soul will go to hell
Immune to all the torment
Immune to hellish flame
They colonized inferno
For them it’s all the same
Hello, hello, my darlings
Ain’t that a lovely sight?
Roll up and gather round
We have a show tonight
To all who in a back rows -
You want to die of age?
There sure will be a chance, now
Come closer to this stage
And DANCE!
A smell of burning eyelids
And crying from below
The Tardigrade Inferno
Is perfect for the show!
