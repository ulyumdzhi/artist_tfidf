Jimmy's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close you can hear him cry

Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
(Sing it) Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
Way down below, way down below

Judy's in the front seat picking up trash
Living on the dole, gotta make that cash
Won't be pretty, won't be sweet
She's just sitting here on her feet

Singing oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
(Go) Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
(Sing) Oh Lord, tell us so, we belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so, we belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below

I've had better days, man
I've seen better days
I've had better ways, man
I know better ways
One, two, three and four
The devil's knocking at your door
Caught in the eye of a dead man's lie
Start your life with your head held high
Now you're on your knees with your head hung low
Big man tells you where to go
Tell them it's good, tell them okay
Don't do a goddamn thing they say

Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so, we belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below

I've seen better ways, man
I know better ways
I've seen better days, man
I've had better days

Gina's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close you can hear the crying
Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so, we belong way down below
Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so, we belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Take me, I'm alive
Never was a girl with a wicked mind
But everything looks better
When the sun goes down

I had everything
Opportunities for eternity
And I could belong to the night
Your eyes, your eyes
I can see in your eyes, your eyes

You make me wanna die
I'll never be good enough
You make me wanna die
And everything you love
Will burn up in the light
Every time I look inside your eyes
You make me wanna die

Taste me, drink my soul
Show me all the things that I shouldn't know
And there's a blue moon on the rise
I had everything
Opportunities for eternity
And I could belong to the night
Your eyes, your eyes
I can see in your eyes, your eyes
Everything in your eyes, your eyes

You make me wanna die
I'll never be good enough
You make me wanna die
And everything you love
Will burn up in the light
Every time I look inside your eyes (I'm burning in the light)
You make me wanna die

I would die for you, my love, my love
I would lie for you, my love, my love (Make me wanna die)
And I would steal for you, my love, my love (Make me wanna die)
I would die for you, my love, my love

We'll burn up in the light
Every time I look inside your eyes (I'm burning in the light)
Look inside your eyes (I'm burning in the light)
I look inside your eyes
You make me wanna die10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Part 1: The Walls Are Closing In

Get your shit together

There's no light
Mama, I can't see at all
There's no one left to break this fall
Mama, there's no one at all
Part 2: Hangman

Semi tabellio prima
Retracto quemadmodum callum
Odi cimussiato bora
Victum calefia doleo
Mia esto nescienta
Lio rumen appello mama
Effascinatio crea
Tichius nova lumen patior
Esto mi doleo solor
Vivax olor ma infecta
Estar in mia altaria
Estur inomina montis
I don't know, won't get out alive, yeah
I think I am gonna spend my last night here
I think I can finally see clear

When they come to hang you
Stand straight, brace your neck, be strong, daughter
When they come to hang you
And you think you've lost control
Don't take your soul

Sono o no ma infecta
Estar in mia altaria
Estur inonima montis
I don't know, won't get out alive, yeah

Time flies by the rank of years
Humans die by the hand of fear

When they come to hang you
Stand straight, brace your neck, be strong, daughter
When they come to hang you
And you think you've lost control
Don't take your soul
In the time of the light before humans had the sight
Spent my life living blind with a picture in my mind
A vision of the sun but now my life is done
As I wait for the light to come, I will take nothing
For what I would bring that won't decompose
As my body is disposed and the earth weights a ton
And now my life is done as I wait for the light to come

When they come to hang you
Stand straight, brace your neck, be strong, daughter
When they come to hang you
And you think you've lost control
Don't take—
And you think you've lost control
Don't take your soul

Mia esto nescienta
Lio rumen appello mama

Jenny died of suicide
With a candle burnin' in her eye
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll"
John forgot what he was on
But he broke the needle, dead and gone
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll""

I wanna go with a shotgun blast
I wanna go with a woman on her back
I wanna go with balls, I won't pray
I wanna go with this bottle in my veins
I wanna go
I wanna go
I wanna go out my way

Amy shot and killed a man
With a gun too heavy in her hand
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll""
Janey had steel in her bones
But she burned away, blood into stone
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll""
I wanna go with a shotgun blast
I wanna go with a woman on her back
I wanna go with this sickness in my throat
I wanna go, killed by rock and roll
I wanna
I wanna go
I wanna go out my way, yeah

I wanna go with a shotgun blast
I wanna go with a motorcycle crash
Out on my own, I don't need to be saved
I wanna go out my way

But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll""7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Year one was lots of fun
But nothin' lasts forever in my dreams
And two, I followed you
Because you knew the way or so it seemed
And three, I still believed
That we would be becoming destiny
And four, I wanted more
But you were movin' on to better things

At twenty-five and still alive
Much longer than expected for a man
At twenty-five, all hope has died
And the glass of my intentions turns to sand
And shatters in my hand

Oh, oh, oh

Five to six, a lie, a kiss
The secrets that were served, we'd never say
Skip to eight, we called it fate
To live, to let us die another day
And nine, I saw the signs
Reflected in the barrel of a gun
Ten, we're here again
Those who loved me burned up in the sun
At twenty-five and still alive
Much longer than expected for a man
At twenty-five, all hope has died
And the glass of my intentions turns to sand
And shatters in my hand
Shatters in my hand

From eleven, twelve, I held the future in my grasp
And all through my teens, I screamed I may not live much past
Twenty-one, two, three, four
Twenty-one, two, three, four
Twenty-one, two, three, four
One, two, three, four

At twenty-five and still alive
Much longer than expected for a man
At twenty-five, all hope has died
And the glass of my intentions
The glass of my intentions
The glass of my intentions turns to sand
It shatters in my hand

Shatters in my hand
In my hand10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Somewhere in the end of all this hate
There's a light ahead
That shines into this grave that's in the end of all this pain
In the night ahead there's a light upon this

House on a hill
The living, living still
Their intention is to kill and they will, they will
But the children are doing fine
I think about them all the time
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will

Somewhere in the end we're all insane
To think a light ahead can save us from this
Grave that's in the end of all this pain
In the night ahead there's a light up on this

House on a hill
The living, living still
Their intention is to kill and they will, they will
But the children are doing fine
I think about them all the time
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will
I am not afraid
I won't burn out in this place
My intention is to fade and I will, I will
In this

House on a hill
The dead are living still
With intentions to kill and they will, they will
Keep your children safe inside
Out of pocket, out of mind
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Father did you miss me?
I’ve been locked up a while
I got caught for what I did
But took it all in style
Laid to rest all my confessions I gave way back when
But now I’m versed in so much worse so I am back again
And he said…

For the lines that I take, I’m going to hell
For the love that I make, I’m going to hell
Getting heavy with the devil, you can hear the wedding bells

Father did you miss me?
Don’t ask me where I’ve been
You know I know, yes I’ve been told
I redefine a sin
I don’t know what’s driving me to put this in my head
Maybe I wish I could die, maybe I am dead
And he said…

For the laughs that I fake, I’m going to hell
For the vows that I break, I’m going to hell
For the ways that I hurt while I’m hiking up my skirt
I am sitting on a throne while they’re buried in the dirt
For the man that I hate, I’m going to hell
Getting heavy with the devil, you can hear the wedding bells
Please forgive me father
I didn’t mean to bother you
The devil’s in me father
He’s inside of everything I do

For the lives that I take, I’m going to hell
For the laws that I break, I’m going to hell
For the love that I hate, I’m going to hell
For the lies that I make, I’m going to hell
For the way I condescend and never lend a hand
My arrogance is making this head buried in the sand
For the souls I forsake, I’m going to hell
Married to the devil, you can hear the wedding bells9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Here we are and I can't think from all the pills, hey
Start the car and take me home
Here we are and you're too drunk to hear a word I say
Start the car and take me home

Just tonight I will stay
And we'll throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
It's telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then it's all because of you, just tonight

Here I am and I can't seem to see straight
But I'm too numb to feel right now
And here I am watching the clock that's ticking away my time
I'm too numb to feel right now

Just tonight I will stay
And we'll throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
It's telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then it's all because of you, just tonight
Just tonight
Do you understand who I am? Do you wanna know?
Can you really see through me? Now I have got to go

But just tonight I won't leave
And I'll lie and you'll believe
Just tonight I will see
That it's all because of me

Just tonight I will stay
And we'll throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
It's telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then it's all because of you
Just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh my god
Wish I was thin
Wish I was a normal human being
I'm just like them
Stuck in the dirt
I am a victim of my own self-worth

And now I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back to when I was so dumb and so innocent

Oh my god
Wish I was black
Wish I had soul when my music attached
I am so white
I shine like the sun
Just like with Eve count it down to the one

And I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back to when I was so dumb and so innocent
Oh my god
Wish I could think
Wish I could do something smarter than sing
But I'm just a face
Painted in mud
Don't try for perfect it's never enough

I'm just hanging with my head down
I'm just hanging with my head down
I'm just hanging with my head down
I'm just hanging with my head down

I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back to when I was so dumb and so innocent

Oh my god
Wish I was dead
Wish I could turn off the noise in my head
Oh my god, wish I could breathe
Enough air in my lungs to muster a scream
Oh my god, wish I was numb
The weight on my back didn't feel like a ton
Oh my god, wish I could pray
Believe in the words your religions all say
Oh my god, wish I could swim
Cause I'm gonna drown in depression again8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Since I met you I've been crazy
Since I've been with you I've been lost
You make everything seem so hazy
Love comes with such a cost
Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?

Follow me down to the river
Drink while the water is clean
Follow me down to the river tonight
I'll be down here on my knees
So follow me down to the river
Follow me down through the trees
Follow me down to the river, man
I'll be down here on my knees
I'll be down here on my knees

Nights avoiding things unholy
Your hand slips across my skin
I go down on you so slowly
Don't confess none of your sins
Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?

Follow me down to the river
Drink while the water is clean
Follow me down to the river tonight
I'll be down here on my knees
So follow me down to the river
Follow me down through the trees
Follow me down to the river, man
I'll be down here on my knees
I'll be down here on my knees

When you're young you always take what you can get
Even bicycles and sprinklers get you wet
Now I know that there's a different way to die
My body breathes
Heart still beats
But I am not alive

Follow me down to the river
Drink while the water is clean
Follow me down to the river tonight
I'll be down here on my knees
So follow me down to the river
Follow me down through the trees
Follow me down to the river, man
I'll be down here on my knees
I'll be down here on my knees
Young love as sweet as can be5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
