Every time I dive in my pool, it's hard to be humble
When I do the breaststroke through an underground tunnel
And come up on the other side in a Jacuzzi
Being greeted by two naked models with suds on their booties
They give me hugs and lots of kisses and they ask me what my wish is
I say go and call your bitches cause there's gonna be a party
Next they wash my body as a team
And they say "Foo, your royal penis is clean!"
And I'm like

Step outside and say hello to my beautiful world
Grandma's cooking breakfast; she makes pancakes the best
I check my MySpace and I've got a lot of friend requests
Yes!
I get to dancing as I, walk through my mansion cause I
Own property from California to the Hamptons and I
Sip from my water fountain that dispenses soda
Look out the window and wave at my next door neighbor Oprah
I check to see how my album's doing today
The group LMFAO goes double platinum, hey

So I take my elevator to the club in my crib like

Hypnotized, this love starts now

I roll with the best click flow so impressive
Shots automatic, better get you a vest quick
(He's heating up!) You could have guessed it
They all compete and they all get bested
Why try to test it, just digest it
Spit so clean that's why I dress so fresh, kid
You see that girl over there she big chested
Let's start my motor boat, face nested
When I do that, she screams all festive
When you do that, she screams, "I'm molested! "
Now you are arrested
While we're in the club being most requested
Step up loud to be the next contestant

Shot clock, three seconds left, I'm just gettin' started
And yo team out of breath
I juke right, fake to the left, pop, shot, count it, all night
I'm gettin' threes like I'm...
I think I might just top the team
Cause I've got the green
That's how I play in the league
And now I'm gonna be MVP, Sky Blu baby

Either way I style on them all day make way
Put a smile for the women unless they know I don't play
People movin when I wake up and possessin' the best shit
Always the first to do with introducing the next shit
I ain't talkin', I ain't even put they neck down yet
To tell the truth a lot of nigga's need a background check, yo
Could give a fuck about your cute buzz
I return in case you may know who the truth was
And when you on the soundtrack and you ain't saying nothin'
I'm in a club bottle-sippin' and the bitches is jumpin'
When we step up in the buildin' and you see how we get it
And watch all of my nigga's back 'till you know how we did it
Throw it all up in the street just see the kid on a roll
And let me bang with this shawty when I take it to the hole

Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole

In Europe they show t-titties all the time
But here in LA every titty a prize
So girl let me see what you tryin to hide
Has either of your titties ever touched the sky
Now if your shy (if your shy)
Just close your eyes (just close your eyes)
And pull your titties out like you part of tha African tribe

Gon foo (Foo)
Gon foo (Foo)
Gon foo (Foo)
Gon foo (Foo)
Gon foo (Foo)
Gon foo (Foo)
I'm Sky Blu and that's my nigga
Redfoo (Foo)

And L-M-F-A-O is the crew crew crew

She love the beats, alright, ok
