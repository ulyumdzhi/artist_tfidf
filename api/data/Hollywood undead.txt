Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show, bitch
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show

Wake up, grab beer, grab rear, shave beard
Put on some scene gear
Gotta get drunk 'fore my mom wakes up
Break-up with my girlfriend so I can bang sluts
I'm Undead, unfed
Been sleeping on bunk beds since ten
So if I don't booze it, I'm gonna lose it
Everybody get to it, do it, get ruined

Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping

When I start drinking, my dick does all my thinking
Hoes want to be seen with me and I like their big, thick titties
D cups with extra filling, take it out, let me lick it quickly
Calm down, it's just a hickey, I'll blame it on this whiskey sipping
Gets me tipsy, drink fast and enjoy your buzz
Take back streets to avoid the fuzz
I wanna take you home but your friends won't let you
I got a 40 in my Ford Fiesta
Buy beer or pay the rent?
My signing bonus was quickly spent
So I'll beat my meat like I'm a fucking butcher
And I'll punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher

Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping

Let's get this party jumping
Let's see some 40 chugging
I wanna see your booty rubbing
Against my dick when I start buzzing
Come on girls, I wanna see you drinking
I wanna see your brains start shrinking
Make a move, I saw you winking
Drunken pussy's what I'm thinking
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I wanna party all night till they call the cops
Fuck a wristband, let's all do keg stand
I'm like Cheech, you got the Chong, hitting up this beer bong
When the cops show up, they're gonna get the finger
And I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm the designated drinker

Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started (What?)
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping

Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show, bitch
Everywhere I go, bitches always know

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

Gone too far, yeah, I'm gone again
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends
One's a bottle of pills, and one's a bottle of Gin
I'm twenty stories up, yeah, up at the top
I polished off this bottle, now it's pushing me off
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft
I bet my mama found my letter, now she's calling the cops
I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it
'Cause now I hear the sirens, and they're off in the distance
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is
I've been trying too long with too dull of a knife
But tonight, I made sure that I sharpened it twice
I never bought a suit before in my life
But when you go to meet God, you know, you wanna look nice!

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

We hit the sky, there goes the light
No more sun, why's it always night?
When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream
When you can't dream, well, what's life mean?
We feel a little pity, but don't empathize
The old are getting older, watch a young man die
A mother and a son and someone you know
Smile at each other and realize you don't
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised
Or what happened to the father who swore he'd stay
I didn't know, 'cause you didn't say
Now mama feels guilt, yeah, mama feels pain
When you were young, you never thought you'd die
Found that you could, but too scared to try
Looked in the mirror and you said goodbye
Climbed to the roof to see if you could fly

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

I wish that I could fly way up in the sky
Like a bird so high, oh, I might just try
I wish that I could fly way up in the sky
Like a bird so high, oh, I might just try
Oh, I might just try
 
Undead! (Undead)
Undead! (Undead)
Undead! (Undead)
Undead! (Undead)

Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway

Look up and see that motherfucking writing on the wall
When you see J3T thirty deep, he's down to brawl
Fuck the haters I see 'cause I hate that you breathe
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fucking disease
I got HU tatted on the front of my arms
The boulevard, brass knuckles in the back of the car
'Cause we drunk-drive Cadillacs, we never go far
But when you see us, motherfuckers, better know who we are
I got one thing to say to punk-asses who hate
Motherfuckers don't know, but you better watch what you say
From these industry fucks to these faggot-ass punks
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfucking drunk
I'm already loud, maybe it's a little too late
Johnny's taking heads off of all faggots who hate
'Cause I'm a God, motherfucker, there's a price to pay
Yeah, I'm a god, motherfucker, and it's Judgment Day

Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway

I'm getting used to this nuisance of fags who badmouth this music
How fucking stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this
You cowards can't, you never will, don't even try to pursue it
I took the chance, I paid the bill, I nearly died for this music
You make me wanna run around pulling my guns out and shit
You're tempting me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrists, get pissed, and go jump off a bridge
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What, you think I just got lucky, didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kid's lips
That shit's as worse as it gets, this verse is over, I quit
Signed "Charlie Scene" on your girlfriend's tits

Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway

White boys with tattoos, p-pointing right at you
We're breaking everything, r-rowdy like a classroom
Pack of wolves 'cause we don't follow the rules
And when you're running your mouth, our razor blades come out
Because there's nothing in my life except my dick and what I spit
So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots talking shit
Speaking of fag, already rapped with the drag
We killed him then we stuffed his body in the Cadillac
B-But you always press and you know I never stress
With Loki DMS, J-Johnny to my left
Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
I grew up on drive-bys and LA gang signs
So what the fuck you know about being a gangster?
And what the fuck you know about being in danger?
You ain't doing this so you know you're just talking shit
Mad at all of us 'cause every song is a fucking hit

Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say

See you duck when we drive by
Undead!
Motherfucking time to ride, ride

Won't you punks just die, die, die?
Undead!
 
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstring
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a madman, the voices keep asking
Born with this soul that don't wanna be saved
Every time I look around, I see what a fiend made
Every time I die, I hope they're digging up my grave
An Undead one like the flag that I wave
I'm not afraid to cry from this cocaine sickness
I'm not afraid to die, let the Good Book witness
I ask and give none, nope, no forgiveness
This is Day of the Dead, and you're on our hit list
So come, all you misfits
Bitch, you're on our hit list

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, holy ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

This is exactly what has to be done, it happened so gradually
It's like I magically happened to be this phantom that candidly
Lets this dagger cut jaggedly while you're gasping so rapidly
While you gag on this rag, I feed you while laughing so happily
It's okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I'll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I've already started, there ain't no saving your heart
This is the Day of the Dead, this ain't no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The fun has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow
And when I'm done, I ain't done 'cause it's hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow
'Cause it's hell that follows

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, holy ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

When the ashes start to rise and the moon falls from the sky
And a thousand candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry on the flames below the sky
Would a thousand souls still pray for you and I?

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

Hold on, Holy Ghost
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Here's to the damned
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Here's to the damned
It's the Day of the Dead
 
I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be
How can I sleep at night? There's a war inside my head
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed
'Cause I am a lion, and you are dead

Here's a story of everything we'll ever be
You can hide, but some of us can never leave
And if you go, I don't need those little things
They remind me of all our little dreams
Can you hear the words? All I can say
We can watch the world even if they walk away
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today
You were born a lion, and a lion you will stay

I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

Remember an army of all those little kids
Living life like they only get a little bit
It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle, and
I'd rather die, won't watch you giving in
I'm sorry, daughter, but your father's not the same
I can look into your eyes, and I'll swear that I will change
But tomorrow is tomorrow, so forgive me if I stay
You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain
After all, only so much we can say
Words can lose their meaning once we walk away
Promise that you love me, watch me as I fade
I'll give you all those things that these liars never gave
Put the hands on the clock and the things we cannot change
Tear it all to pieces and take back what I made
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save
'Cause I am just a lion, and a lion I will stay

I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

Hey, I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home
Hey, I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home, hey

I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be
 
I loved you, you made me hate me, you gave me
Hate, see? It saved me, and these tears are deadly
You feel that? I'd rip back every time you tried to steal that
You feel bad? You feel sad? I'm sorry, hell no, fuck that
It was my heart, it was my life, it was my start, it was your knife
This strife, it dies, this life and these lies
And these lungs have sung this song for too long
And it's true, I hurt to remember I loved you

And I've lost it all, fell today, it's all the same
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no
And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no

I wish I could've quit you, I wish I never missed you
And told you that I loved you every time I fucked you
The future that we both drew and all the shit we've been through
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew
How could you do this to me? Look at what I made for you
It never was enough, and the world is what I gave to you
I used to be love-struck, now I'm just fucked up
Pull up my sleeve and see the pattern of my cuts

And I've lost it all, fell today, it’s all the same
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no
And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no

Seems like all we had is over now
You left to rest
And your tears are dried up now
You just lay without a sound
Seems like all we had is over now
You left to rest
And my fears are over now
I can leave with my head down

And I've lost it all, fell today, it’s all the same
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no
And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no

I'm sorry
I used to be love-struck, now I'm just fucked up
I'm sorry
Pull up my sleeve and see the pattern of my cuts
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I used to be love-struck, now I'm just fucked up
I'm sorry
Pull up my sleeve and see the pattern of my cuts
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, no
 
I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it

So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
So take a page from my book
Roll it up and get cooked
Watch these ladies get hooked
While all these haters get shook
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye

We gonna rise up to the top, we've been through it all
Been to fucking hell and back, our backs against the wall
Got the dove and grenade flag on display
And every fucking critic's gonna listen when we say

I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it

So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
So take a page from my book
Roll it up and get cooked
Watch these ladies get hooked
While all these haters get shook
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye

So just understand nothing gets in my way
I can show you firsthand if you got something to say
If you think you can hold me down, you better think twice
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment every day of my life
These fucking people always say the same old thing
But you can't slay or conquer the king
I'm from a nightmare, but I'm living the dream
You need to back up if you're not with my team

'Cause I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it

So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
So take a page from my book
Roll it up and get cooked
Watch these ladies get hooked
While all these haters get shook
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
You better wave bye bye
You better wave bye bye
You better wave bye bye
You better wave bye bye
 
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts

If you can lose it all, then welcome to Broadway
Silicone dreams and your name on the marquee
And I can hold it up, but I hold it up hardly
It's hotter here in hell, but it's getting real dark, see?
So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends
And every step, another step, you're walking on my dreams
And every breath, another breath, you're breathing when I breathe
I watch them all come, gotta watch the rest go
I'm married to the devil in the city of angels
So come, all you wicked, to the world of the empty
I know I need it all, so, baby, don't tempt me
I'm knocking on your door, nope, nobody sent me
Just checking all you bitches like I'm checking this check sheet
So put your hats on; Lohner, don't get soft
You can see God when I take my mask off

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts

The fame is your best friend, you love it, no questions
Beating down the door is the face of rejection
And once again, it's a tragedy anthem
We never wanted more, we never needed your blessing
Who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream?
'Cause stories aren't told about the ones unseen
With a gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky
Crooked smile on his face, he doesn't think he can die
So grab a pick and an ax 'cause we try, we cry
Into the bottle of Jack, we die inside
So when you look in his eyes, what you see now?
Murder the monster you've made and watch him bleed out
We're in a life where it's kill or lose
Just lie, motherfucker, till you hear the truth
From under the street, through the gutters of youth
Just cry, motherfucker, yeah, I'm talking to you

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts

(No one) From the city of angels
(No one) An empty vessel of devils
(Can take away what's ours)
Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes, see the world that you gave us
(No one) From the city of angels
(No one) An empty vessel of devils
(Can take away what's ours)
Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes, see the world that you gave us

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts

From the city of angels (We are, we are)
An empty vessel of devils
Is there no one to save us? (We are, we are)
Through my eyes, see the world that you gave us
From the city of angels (And our hearts, our hearts)
An empty vessel of devils
Is there no one to save us? ('Cause we are, we are)
Through my eyes, see the world that you gave us
 
Goodnight, sleep tight, don't let the dead bite

Johnny 3 and he's dipping in the four-door
.44 and it's pointing at your window
Ain't a good shot, here come four more
Getting hot, so I play in the snow
In a town made wicked, made from these wicked things
See the dead on the cover of a magazine
See my smile, it was born from amphetamines
Better duck 'cause it's war on my enemies
Oh God, I think I lost it, oh no
Lost some, wanna watch the rest go
A madman when I'm mixed with SoCo
And who would've thought a man could sink to so low?
Now, who wants to die from the Mossberg shotty?
Putting holes in the hotel lobby
All you fake bitches are just another hobby
And I'll let you dig where I dump your body

What would you do if I told you I hate you?
What would you do if your life's on the line?
What would you say if I told you I hate you?
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind!

You know I got a grenade, and it's got your name on it
I'mma spit on your grave and engrave a dick on it
People say I'm insane and to put the brakes on it
Let me buy you a drink, how 'bout a roofie, gin, and tonic?
Yeah, Charlie Scene seems to be so hated
It's just me being intoxicated
'Cause being sober's so overrated
Hollywood Undead, what have you created?
I know that we have never really met before
But, tell me, does this rag smell like chloroform?
You know that I'm the reason people lock their doors
But I got nothing but time, so I'mma wait on the porch
You got nowhere to run too, so don't try hiding
'Cause I'm known to be like Jack Nicholson from "The Shining"
Yeah, I'm breaking your door down, so don't try fighting
Yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed, or the dead keep biting

What would you do if I told you I hate you?
What would you do if your life's on the line?
What would you say if I told you I hate you?
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind!

Goodnight, sleep tight, don't let the dead bite
Wrap a rope around your head and watch you as you take flight

You better check twice, look under your bed
Turn on your night light and cover up your head
'Cause we do exist and there's no need to pretend
That you're not afraid of meeting the Undead
Red, redrum when you look into these eyes
Say goodnight 'cause it's almost your bedtime
Buckle up 'cause it's time to fly
You got a first-class ticket to Columbia neck ties
Take a seat, you can sit in the front row
The voice in your head is just me in your headphones
Everybody knows that we're the devil's heroes
Come and get a ticket, follow me to the creep show

What would you do if I told you I hate you?
What would you do if your life's on the line?
What would you say if I told you I hate you?
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind!

Goodnight, sleep tight, don't let the dead bite
Wrap a rope around your head and watch you as you take flight
Goodnight, sleep tight, don't let the dead bite
Wrap a rope around your head and watch you as you take flight
 
If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And I'mma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I'll drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good, then it can't be wrong
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And we be taking shots, and if not, you're nerdy

We only leave a pre-party to go party some more
I'm already shitfaced before I walk in the door
This girl's rubbing on my leg, I've never met her before
And now she's making her way down to my gentleman's sword
It might be the drugs talking or the shots of Patrón
But these bitches look like models, and they're ready to bone
I'll take 'em back to my parents' house, we'll be Home Alone
I'll slap them chicks and have 'em yelling like Macaulay Culkin
She's tearing it up, yeah, she's dancing her ass off
This girl's like a Mac the way she's riding my laptop
I'm tryna get my rocks off, so don't try to cock-block
Or I'll grab my sawed-off, and I'll blow your cock off
You know we drink so much, we're getting drunk for weeks
We drink so much Goose, we're turning into geese
Me and my crew fly the V through VIP
These bitches play my skin flute like they're Kenny G

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And I'mma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I'll drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good, then it can't be wrong
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And we be taking shots, and if not, you're nerdy

If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got shit, throw your hands up

Get gone with it, there's nothing wrong with it
Take shots, don't stop, sing along with it
I wanna feel you bounce, girl, go up and down
Take shots, won't stop till I'm passing out
So girl, get down, you can have more
And you can shake your hips around on my man sword
You're gonna have to rock this house, I'm your landlord
So let your sweat drip down on the dance floor
I ain't tryna go home with nolla, nolla
We can hit the dance floor when you wanna, wanna
Girl, you know you're feeling me so holla, holla
'Cause everyone compared to me is nada, nada
Okay, dawg, this has gone on for way long
Can't quit my day job till I'm played on K-ROQ
It's chaos, I'm in the club with my shades on
And I'm about to Smack That like I'm Akon

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And I'mma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I'll drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good, then it can't be wrong
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And we be taking shots, and if not, you're nerdy

If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got shit, throw your hands up
If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got shit, throw your hands up

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And I'mma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I'll drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good, then it can't be wrong
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And we be taking shots, and if not, you're nerdy

If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
