What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Now sing with me, y'all (One world, one world)
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the w-world, world, yeah
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)80EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Layin' on the ground died from a choke

Welcome
Welcome to The E.N.D
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
Everything around you is changing
Nothing stays the same
This version of myself is not permanent
Tomorrow, I will be different
The energy never dies
Energy cannot be destroyed, or created
It always is, and it always will be
This is the end, and the beginning..
Forever infinite
Welcome

From all intellect, collect the rhythm effect
To lose your inhibition follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition

Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

Honey got her sexy on steamin'
She givin' hotness a new meanin'
Perfection, mami, you gleamin'
Inception, you got a brother dreamin', dreamin'
Damn, baby, I'm feenin'
I'm tryna holla at you, I'm screamin'
Let me love you down this evenin'
Lovie lovie, yeah, you know you are my demon
Girl, we can form a team, and
I could be the King, you could be the Queen and
My mind's dirty and it don't need cleanin'
I love you long time, so you know the meanin'

Oh, baby, I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feeling high, and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough
Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

Honey got me runnin' like I'm Flo Jo
Signs her name on my heart with an "XO"
Love so sweet, got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes
Meantime, I wait for the next time
She come around for a toast to the best time
We LOL back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin' for her love, I confess I'm
Something 'bout her smile and the convo
Got me high and I ain't comin' down, yo
My heart's pumpin' out louder than electro
She got me feelin' like Mr. Roboto​

Oh, baby, I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feeling high, and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough
Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

This is mega switch-up
Switch-up, switch-up
I just can't switch-up

Locked, sunk in your bedrock
Heart, pumpin' your love-shot
Knocked out by your cold-shot
I'm, stuck in your headlock (Switch up)
Can't stop, won't quit
Makin' me fiend, give it to me
I want it all, you know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecstasy (Switch up)
Addicted, I can't get away from you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (Switch up)
I want your lovin' right next to me
And I can't erase you out of my memory

I just can't switch-up25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Let's get retarded in here
And the bass keeps running, running and runnin runnin'
And runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin, and runnin' runnnin' and...

In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect collect the rhythm effect
Obstacles are inefficient, follow your intuiton
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burn it 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from north, west, east, south

Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get retarded, get retarded, get retarded

Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here), yeah
Lose control, of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
Get started, get stupid
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it
Step by step like an infant new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'

Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get retarded, get retarded, get retarded

Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here), yeah

Runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin'
C'mon y'all, let's get (Coo-koo), c'mon, let's get (Coo-koo) in here
C'mon y'all, let's get (Coo-koo), c'mon, let's get (Coo-koo) in here

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Let's get ill, that's the deal
Ap the gate, and Will bring the thugged out drill (Just)
Lose your mind, this is the time
Y'all can't stand still, trust and bang your spine (Just)
Bob your head like epilepsy
Up inside the club or in your Bentley
Get messy, loud and sick
You mind pass normal on another head trip
So, come them now, do not correct it
Let's get ignorant, let's get hectic

Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get retarded, get retarded, get retarded

Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
