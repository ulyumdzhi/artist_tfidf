Sucker love is heaven sent
You pucker up, our passion's spent
My heart's a tart, your body's rent
My body's broken, yours is bent
Carve your name into my arm
Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed
Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Sucker love, a box I choose
No other box I choose to use
Another love I would abuse
No circumstances could excuse
In the shape of things to come
Too much poison come undone
Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...
Sucker love is known to swing
Prone to cling and waste these things
Pucker up for heavens sake
There's never been so much at stake
I serve my head up on a plate
It's only comfort, calling late
Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Like the naked leads the blind
I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind
Sucker love I always find
Someone to bruise and leave behind
All alone in space and time
There's nothing here but what here's mine
Something borrowed, something blue
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who's dressed in leather
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed, which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather

A friend in need's a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she's pressed, she will undress
And then she's boxing clever
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever

Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed, which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever,

Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning

A friend in need's a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she's pressed, she will undress
And then she's boxing clever
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who's dressed in leather9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide
I'll take it by your side
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
I'll take it by your side
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
I'll take it by your side
Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide
I'll take it by your side

Tick - tock
Tick - tock
Tick - tock
Tick - tick
Tick - tick
Tick - tock

I'm unclean, a libertine
And every time you vent your spleen
I seem to lose the power of speech
You're slipping slowly from my reach
You grow me like an evergreen
You've never seen the lonely me at all
I
Take the plan, spin it sideways
I
Fall

Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
(Take the plan, spin it sideways)
Without you, I'm nothing at all10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
"If I only could, I'd be running up that hill
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill"

It doesn't hurt me
You want to feel how it feels?
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
You want to hear about the deal I'm making?
You (be running up that hill)
You and me (be running up that hill)

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
There's a thunder in our hearts, baby
So much hate for the ones we love
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You (be running up that hill)
You and me (be running up that hill)
You and me won't be unhappy
And if I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh

C'mon, baby, c'mon, c'mon darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

If I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem
(If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill)7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Remember me when you're the one who's silver screened
Remember me when you're the one you always dreamed
Remember me whenever noses start to bleed
Remember me, special needs

Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior

Remember me when you clinch your movie deal
And think of me stuck in my chair that has four wheels
Remember me through flash photography and screams
Remember me, special dreams

Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior
Remember me
Remember me

Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior

You are one of God's mistakes
You crying, tragic waste of skin
I'm well aware of how it aches
And you still won't let me in
Now, I'm breaking down your door
To try and save your swollen face
Though I don't like you anymore
You lying, trying waste of space

Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And a voice that made me cry
My, oh, my

You were mother nature's son
Someone to whom I could relate
Your needle and your damage done
Remains a sordid twist of fate
Now, I'm tryin' to wake you up
To pull you from the liquid sky
'Cause if I don't, we'll both end up
With just your song to say goodbye
My, oh, my
A song to say goodbye
A song to say goodbye
A song to say

Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And a voice that made me cry

It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Since we're feeling so anaesthetised
In our comfort zone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
We're running out of alibis
On the second of May
Reminds me of the summertime
On this winter's day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

Every step we take that's synchronized
Every broken bone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
You shower me with lullabies
As you're walking away
Reminds me that it's killing time
On this fateful day
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

From the time we intercepted
Feels a lot like suicide
Slow and sad, grown inside us
Arouse and see you're mine
(See you at the bitter end)
Love has seen your run-around
Who wanna seek you now?
I want a peace
I'd whine out
(See you at the bitter end)
Love's reached his side
Grab this gentleness inside
Heard a cry
Six feet down
(See you at the bitter end)
In six weeks' time
The mess you left
Will end2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I was alone, falling free
Trying my best not to forget
What happened to us, what happened to me
What happened as I let it slip
I was confused by the powers that be
Forgetting names and faces
Passers by, were looking at me
As if they could erase it
Baby...did you forget to take your meds?
Baby...did you forget to take your meds?
I was alone, staring over the ledge
Trying my best not to forget
All manner of joy, all manner of glee
And our one heroic pledge
How it mattered to us, how it mattered to me
And the consequences
I was confused, by the birds and the bees
Forgetting if I meant it
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
I was alone, falling free, trying my best not to forget5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Coming up beyond belief
On this coronary thief
More than just the leitmotif
More chaotic, no relief
I'll describe the way I feel
Weeping wounds that never heal
Can the savior be for real
Or are you just my seventh seal?

No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Just like I swallowed half my stash
And never ever wanna crash
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand
Gravity, no escaping
Gravity
Gravity, no escaping
Not for free
I fall down, hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
Every time you seem to come around
I'll describe the way I feel
You're my new Achilles' heel
Can the savior be for real
Or are you just my seventh seal?

No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Just like I swallowed half my stash
And never ever wanna crash
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand
Gravity, no escaping
Gravity
Gravity, no escaping
Not for free
I fall down, hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
Every time you seem to come around
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity

I hold an image of the ashtray girl
Of cigarette burns on my chest
I wrote a poem that described her world
And put our friendship to the test
And late at night
Whilst on all fours
She used to watch me kiss the floor
What's wrong with this picture?
What's wrong with this picture?

Farewell the ashtray girl
Forbidden snowflake
Beware this troubled world
Watch out for earthquakes
Goodbye to open sores
To broken semaphore
You know we miss her
We miss her picture

Sometimes it's fated
Disintegrated
For fear of growing old
Sometimes it's fated
Assassinated
For fear of growing old
Farewell the ashtray girl
Angelic fruitcake
Beware this troubled world
Control your intake
Goodbye to open sores
Goodbye and furthermore
You know we miss her
We miss her picture

Sometimes it's fated
Disintegrated
For fear of growing old
Sometimes it's fated
Assassinated
For fear of growing old

Hang on
Though we try
It's gone
Hang on
Though we try
It's gone
Sometimes it's fated
Disintegrated
For fear of growing old
Sometimes it's fated
Assassinated
For fear of growing old

Can’t stop growing old
Can’t stop growing old
Can’t stop growing old
Can’t stop growing old
Can’t stop growing old1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
