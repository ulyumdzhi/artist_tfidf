I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river, and it made me complete

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go?
So why don't we go?
Ooh, aah

This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know
 
You say you wander your own land
But when I think about it
I don't see how you can
You're aching, you're breaking
And I can see the pain in your eyes
Says everybody's changing
And I don't know why

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game, I
Try to stay awake and remember my name, but
Everybody's changing
And I don't feel the same

You're gone from here
Soon you will disappear
Fading into beautiful light
'Cause everybody's changing
And I don't feel right

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game, I
Try to stay awake and remember my name, but
Everybody's changing
And I don't feel the same


So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game, I
Try to stay awake and remember my name, but
Everybody's changing
And I don't feel the same
Ah! Everybody's changing
And I don't feel the same
 
This is the last time
That I will say these words
I remember the first time
The first of many lies
Sweep it into the corner
Or hide it under the bed
Say these things, they go away
But they never do

Something I wasn't sure of
But I was in the middle of
Something I forget now
But I've seen too little of

The last time
You fall on me for anything you like
Your one last line
You fall on me for anything you like
And years make everything alright
You fall on me for anything you like
And I, no, I don't mind

This is the last time
That I will show my face
One last tender lie and
Then I'm out of this place
Tread it into the carpet
Or hide it under the stairs
You say that some things never die
Well, I tried and I tried

Something I wasn't sure of
But I was in the middle of
Something I forget now
But I've seen too little of

The last time
You fall on me for anything you like
Your one last line
You fall on me for anything you like
And years make everything alright
You fall on me for anything you like
And I, no, I don't mind

The last time
You fall on me for anything you like
Your one last line
You fall on me for anything you like
And years make everything alright
You fall on me for anything you like
And I, no, I don't mind
 
Many's the time I ran with you down
The rainy roads of our old town
Many the lives we lived in each day
And buried all together

Don't laugh at me
Don't look away

You'll follow me back
With the sun in your eyes
And on your own
Bedshaped on legs of stone
You'll knock on my door
And up we'll go
In white light
I don't think so
But what do I know? What do I know?
I know

I know you think I'm holding you down
And I've fallen by the wayside now
And I don't understand the same things as you
But I do

Don't laugh at me
Don't look away

You'll follow me back
With the sun in your eyes
And on your own
Bedshaped on legs of stone
You'll knock on my door
And up we'll go
In white light
I don't think so
But what do I know? What do I know?
I know


Oh, and up we'll go
In white light
I don't think so
But what do I know? What do I know?
I know
 
A turning tide
Lovers at a great divide
Why do you laugh
When I know that you're hurt inside?

And why'd you say
It's just another day, nothing in my way
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna stay
So there's nothing left to say?
And why'd you lie
When you wanna die, when you hurt inside
Don't know what you lie for anyway
Now there's nothing left to say

A tell-tale sign
You don't know where to draw the line

And why'd you say
It's just another day, nothing in my way
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna stay
So there's nothing left to say
And why'd you lie
When you wanna die, when you hurt inside
Don't know what you lie for anyway
Now there's nothing left to say

Well, for a lonely soul
You're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul
You're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul, it seems to me
That you're having such a nice time
You're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul
You're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul
You're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul, it seems to me
That you're having such a nice time
You're having such a nice time
 
Well they said you were a bright child
Never anything but joy behind your eyes
No sign of all the dark clouds
Spreading like volcanic dust over your blue skies
Now they're looking for an answer
Where the rot set in and set up the landslide

But it only makes it worse now
You're like a puzzle to be worked out

And it's the voices in your head now
Saying there's something wrong about the way I feel
A broken link, a missing part, a punctured wheel

And it's not what you expected
The way the world you built loves to cut you down
The way your head gets twisted
And you sit up all night trying to figure it out
And they say you've made your bed now
Don't you see you've brought it on yourself

And they say that you should move on
But you can't even get your shoes on

And it's the voices in your head now
Saying there's something wrong about the way I feel
A broken link, a missing part, a punctured wheel
It doesn't matter what you say now
It's like some vision in the stars that seems so real
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel

And everyone else has got things sorted out
You stand on the edge talking to yourself
You're young, left behind and tangled up inside

And it's not what you expected
The way your head gets twisted
And it's the voices in your head now
(And it's the voices in your head now)

And it's the voices in your head now
Saying there's something wrong about the way I feel
A broken link, a missing part, a punctured wheel
It doesn't matter what you say now
It's like some vision in the stars that seems so real
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel

The way I feel
It's like some vision in the stars that seems so real
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
 
I wanna hand you my heart and let you carry the load
Nobody tells you anything you need to know
I need a friend but a friend is so hard to find
I need an answer but I'm always one step behind

Cause it takes time
Learning to fly

Do you ever feel like all you want is to go home
To kiss the earth, to weave a way through this storm
Some days I rage like a fire in the wilderness
Some days I only need the darkness and a place to rest

Oh it takes time
(It takes time)
Learning to fly

Tear up this town
Blinking in the sunlight as the walls come down
This fire will burn
Digging for a truth that just can't be found
Don't want your lessons in love
I want to tear it all up

I need a friend but a friend is so hard to find
I need an answer but I'm always one step behind
Oh it takes time
(It takes time)
Yes, it takes time
(It takes time)
Learning to fly

Tear up this town
Blinking in the sunlight as the walls come down
This fire will burn
Digging for a truth that just can't be found
Don't want your lessons in love
I want to tear it all up
 
I'm going back to a time when we owned this town
Down Powder Mill Lane, in the battlegrounds
We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns
I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you
When we talked about things we were gonna do
We were wide eyed dreamers and wiser too

We'd go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
Watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

I'm begging you for some sign
But you've still got nothing to say
Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away
I'm a better man now than I was that day

Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
Watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
To take turns, as the stars of the Sovereign Light Café

I wheel my bike off the train
Up the North Trade Road
Look for you on Marley Lane
In every building, every street sign
Oh why did we ever go so far from home?

Well you've got nothing to hide
You can't change who you really are
You can get a big house and a faster car
You can run away boy, but you won't go far

Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
Watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
To take turns, as the stars of the Sovereign Light Café

Sha La la la la la Yeah Yeah
I'm going where the people know my name
 
I, I always thought that I knew
I'd always have the right to
Be living in the kingdom of the good and true
And so on, but now I think I was wrong
And you were laughing along
And now I look a fool for thinking you were on my side

Is it any wonder I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

Sometimes
It's hard to know where I stand
It's hard to know where I am
Well, maybe it's a puzzle I don't understand
But sometimes
I get the feeling that I'm
Stranded in the wrong time
Where love is just a lyric in a children's rhyme
A sound bite

Is it any wonder I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?
Oh, these days
After all the misery you made
Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?

Nothing left beside this old cathedral
Just the sad lonely spires
How do you make it right
Oh, but you try

Is it any wonder I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?
Oh, these days, after all the misery you made
Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?
 
When you, when you forget your name
When old faces all look the same
Meet me in the morning when you wake up
Meet me in the morning then you'll wake up

If only I don't bend and break
I'll meet you on the other side
I'll meet you in the light
If only I don't suffocate
I'll meet you in the morning when you wake

Bitter and hardened heart
Ah! Aching, waiting for life to start
Meet me in the morning when you wake up
Meet me in the morning then you'll wake up

If only I don't bend and break
I'll meet you on the other side
I'll meet you in the light
If only I don't suffocate
I'll meet you in the morning when you wake


If only I don't bend and break
I'll meet you on the other side
I'll meet you in the light
If only I don't suffocate
I'll meet you in the morning when you wake
I'll meet you on the other side
I'll meet you in the light
If only I don't suffocate
I'll meet you in the morning when you wake
