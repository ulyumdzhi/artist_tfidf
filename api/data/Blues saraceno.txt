Oh my lord

Evil comes if you call my name
The wicked, they shall rise
The river sand's gonna wash me clean
The river don't run dry

Oh my lord
Hear my woe
There's blood upon the valley
Deliver me from worry
The devils hand is gonna strike me down
Gut me to my grave
The river's song is gonna pull me through
The river she can save

Oh my lord take this soul
Lay me at the bottom of the river
The devil has come to carry me home
Lay me at the bottom
The bottom of the -

When I got to Memphis
To put my ol' baby down
Despair was all aroud me
Confusion is what I found
So I called me the sheriff
I said bring my wife the gun
But please don't let her hurt me now
That girl just havin' fun

He said
I can't take you to heaven
I can't save your soul
I can't promise forever

Hey, yeah save my soul
Got my heart in your hands
I can't feel my soul

Well I found me a doctor
To get me what I need
Paranoia had surround me
Smoke and fire is what I see
So he hands me a bible
To take my last stand
But the devil he done ignore me
While the doctor does all he can

He said
I can't take you to heaven
I can't save your soul
I can't promise forever

I can't feel, feel my soul
I got my heart in your hands
I can't feel
I got my heart in your hands
I can't feel, feel my soul
 
Grave digger, grave digger
Send me on my way
Release me to this earth
Within this shallow grave
Grave digger, grave digger
Bring me to my knees
Forget what I have done
Forgive me if you please
Save me if you can, the time for me has come
Let me be the one that got away...
Grave digger, grave digger
Slowly fill me grave
Whisper to your God
Allow me to be saved
Grave digger, grave digger
Pray for my lost soul
Release me from this earth
Allow me to grow old
Save me if you can, the time for me has come
Let me be the one that got away...
Oh my God, can I be saved and not forgot
I hold out hope
It's not too late so I'll pray
I'll pray it's not too late
Grave digger, grave digger
Rest these weary bones
Help me on my way
Don't let me die alone
Grave digger, grave digger
Take what I have left
Give it to the lost
Upon my dying breath
Save me if you can, the time for me has come
Let me be the one that got away X3
 
Farewell my love
We'll be together soon
I'm resting with the angels
They'll carry me to you

Realize my dear
We'll see each other soon
We'll meet up in the heavens
I'll wait alone for you

Oh! I hear them say
The angels are calling me back home

Good night, my dear
Bestill your worried heart
Keep me in your prayers
We'll never be apart!

Take heed, sweet love
You'll never be alone
I'm watching from the heavens
To keep you safe from harm

Oh! I hear them say
The angels call to me!
And when their trumpets play
The angels will carry me back home!

Oh! I hear them say
The angels call to me!
And when their trumpets play
The angels will carry me back home!

They're calling me back home
 
My mother's helper
She had herself a baby
And didn't mean to drown it in the bath
Her lovely brother
He took himself a lover
And didn't mean to bury him out back
They went Ooooooo
Ooooooo, Ooooooo
Their judgement day shall come
Graverobber's daughters
They poisoned their father
Couldn't take what he would do at night
Their youngest sister
She doesn't even miss him
The things he did to them just were not right
They went Ooooooo
Oooooooo, Ooooooo
And they know
That judgement day shall come
Oooooooo
The wicked walk alone
Oooooooo
Into damnation
Oooooooo
Those suffering of soul (OR, No suffering I've sown)
Oooooooo
Can find salvation
Salvation
Town's oldest lady
She sits alone, waiting
Counting all the money that she stole
Slave trader's cousin
He hung a man for nothing
And plans to take that secret to the grave
They go Ooooooo
Ooooooo, Ooooooo
And they know
Judgement day shall come
And they know
Judgement day shall come
And they know
The judgement day shall come
 
You may run for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Let me tell you the god's gonna cut you down
Let me tell you the god's gonna cut you down
My god spoke and he spoke so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He put one hand upon my head
Great god almighty let me tell you what he said
Go tell that long tongued liar
Go tell that midnight rider
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell them the god's gonna cut them down
Tell them the god's gonna strike them down
You may run for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Let me tell you the god's gonna cut you down
You may throw your rock and hide your hand
Working in the dark against your fellow man
As sure as god made the day and the night
What you do in the dark will be brought to the light
You may run and hide, slip and slide
Trying to make time with your neighbour's wife
Brother let me tell you as sure as you're born
You better leave that woman alone
You may run, for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Let me tell you the god's gonna cut you down
Let me tell you the god's gonna cut him down
One of these days, you can mark my word
You think a man is a way at work
And you will knock up on that door
That's all son, you'll knock no more
You may run for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Run on, for a long time
Let me tell you the god's gonna cut you down
You may run for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you the god's gonna cut you down
Let me tell you the god's gonna cut you down
Let me tell you the god's gonna cut you down
 
Well I suffer long
Thru ill and woe
Done so many wrong
I don't even know

'Cause I can't change
I can't change this cold black heart

When the time has come
There ain't no forgiveness
I ain't a believer
I'm a bad, bad man

Well, i've cut 'em down
On the killing floor
And i've brought the crown
Of death before

'Cause I can't change
I can't change this cold black heart

When the time has come
There ain't no forgiveness
I ain't a believer
I'm a bad, bad man

When the deal is done
There ain't no forgiveness
I ain't a believer
I'm a bad, bad man
I'm a bad, bad man
 
The wicked
Save yourself
For the devil is on his way
So you pray
So you pray
But you can't hide
You can't hide
When evil calls your name
Salvation
When the heavens meet the grave
So you wait
So you wait
But you can't hide
You can't hide
When evil calls your name
Them bells for thy shall told
The fall of heavens gate
The rise of the unjust
As the wicked
As the wicked has their way
Damnation
The dogs are on their way
So you pray
So you pray
But you can't hide
You can't hide
When evil calls your name
You can't try
You can't try
When evil calls your name
You can't hide
You can't hide
When evil calls your name
