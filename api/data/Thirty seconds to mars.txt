(Do you believe?) Walk on water

Can you even see what you're fighting for?
Blood lust and a holy war
Listen up, hear the patriot shout:
"Times are changing"
In the end, the choice was clear
Take a shot in the face of fear
Fist up in the firing line
Times are changing

Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
(Do you believe?)

Look at the sky, see a dying star
A white lie, sets a man on fire
Making love with the devil hurts
Times are changing
A thin line, the whole truth
The far right, the left view
Breaking all those promises made
Times are changing
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water

Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

What if I wanted to break?
Laugh it all off in your face
What would you do? (Woah)
What if I fell to the floor?
Couldn't take this anymore
What would you do, do, do?

Come break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you

What if I wanted to fight
Beg for the rest of my life
What would you do, do, do?
You say you wanted more
What are you waiting for?
I'm not running from you, from you

Come break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you
Look in my eyes
You're killin' me, killin' me
All I wanted was you
I tried to be someone else, but nothin' seemed to change
I know now, this is who I really am inside
Finally found myself, fighting for a chance
I know now, this is who I really am
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Come break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you, you, you
Look in my eyes
You're killin' me, killin' me
All I wanted was you

Come, break me down, break me down, break me down
(You say you wanted more) What if I wanted to break?
(What are you waiting for?)
(I'm not running from you) What if I, what if I, what if I, what if I
Bury me, bury me47EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
No matter how many times that you told me
You wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took
You still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you'd lie wide awake
To the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

As the days go by, the night's on fire

Tell me, would you kill to save a life?
Tell me, would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

No matter how many deaths that I die
I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live
I will never regret
There is a fire inside of this heart
And a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God?
Where is your God?
Where is your God?
Do you really want? Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want? Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to live a lie?

Tell me, would you kill to save a life?
Tell me, would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

The promises we made were not enough (Never play the game again)
The prayers that we had prayed were like a drug (Never gonna hit the air)
The secrets that we sold were never known (Never sing the song the same)
The love we had, the love we had, we had to let it go
(Never giving in again, never giving in again)

Tell me, would you kill to save a life?
Tell me, would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

Oh, this hurricane
Oh, this hurricane
Oh, this hurricane
Oh
Do you really want, do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want, do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to live a lie?22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We burned and we bled, we try to forget
But the memories left are still haunting
The walls that we built from bottles and pills
We swallow until we're not talking

I, I am a man on fire
You, a violent desire

What a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Don't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome (Oh, oh)
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove

Started a stranger, a lover in danger
The edge of a knife
The face of an angel, the heart of a ghost
Was it a dream?

I, I am a man on fire
You, a violent desire
What a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Don't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome (Oh, oh)
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh)

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I, I am a man on fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
You, a violent desire

A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Into the night, desperate and broken
The sound of a fight, father has spoken

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell, heaven and hell

Into your eyes, hopeless and taken
We stole our new lives through blood and name
In defense of our dreams
In defense of our dreams
We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell, heaven and hell

The age of man is over
A darkness comes at dawn
These lessons that we've learned here
Have only just begun

We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell

We are the kings
We are the queens
We are the kings
We are the queens19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You are insane, my desire
A violent daydream, love, love
You are crazy, a perfect liar
Said you'd save me, love, love

I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
I'd have to swallow all your lies

I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other, be your lover
Never said

You are insane, my desire
A dangerous game, love, love
You are crazy, perfect liar
Simply save me, love, love

I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
I'd have to swallow all your lies
I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other, be your lover
Never said
Oh, woah, no, oh, no, woah
Love is madness

I knew the moment

Love is madness

Whatever you do, don't ever play my game
Too many years being the king of pain
You gotta lose it all if you wanna take control
Sell yourself to save your soul

Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me from the lovers in my life
Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me

Whatever you do, don't ever lose your faith
The devil's quick to love lust and fame
Better to say yes than never know, oh, oh
Sell yourself to save your soul

Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me from the lovers in my life
Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me
Sell yourself to save your soul, (you gotta) oh, oh
Sell yourself to save your soul, (you gotta) oh, oh
Sell yourself to save your soul, (you gotta) oh, oh
Sell yourself to save your soul

Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me from the lovers in my life
Rescue me from the demons in my mind

Love is like problems, we all got 'em

A dark night, remember, the sunrise, surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way
Hands tied, remember, it's suicide to surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way

I have a one-track mind, I have a one track-mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one-track mind, ooh

Sex and lies, remember, look in my eyes, surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way
Outta luck, outta time, outta sight, I'm outta mind, mind

I have a one-track mind, I have a one-track mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one-track mind, ooh

Float around town, made it official now
Think about you every now and again
There's been times, spendin days when I'm with you, girl
On my downtime, locking in, I take a ride around downtown
I'm not in the right town, come alive in the nighttime
Wasn't the right state, wasn't the right mind
Love is like problems, we all got 'em
How come when you stop a problem
Everybody problems become your problem?
Let 'em cry 'bout it, ain't my problem
Ain't my fault, Mystikal, Silkk the Shocker
Heard it's only thirty seconds to Mars
And it took you even less just to get to my heart
I have a one-track mind, method to the madness
One track-mind, method to the madness
One track-mind, method to the madness
One track-mind8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I don't remember the moment I tried to forget
I lost myself, is it better not said
Now I'm closer to the edge
It was a thousand to one and a million to two
Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you
Closer to the edge

No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no

(Can you, can you, can you, can you)
Can you imagine a time when the truth ran free?
The birth of a sun, the death of a dream
Closer to the edge
This never ending story
Paid for with pride and faith
We all fall short of glory
Lost in our fate
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
(No, no, no, no)

(No, no, no, no)
I will never forget (No, no)
I will never regret  (No, no)
I will live my life (No, no, no, no)
I will never forget (No, no)
I will never regret (No, no)
I will live my life

No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
(No, no, no, no)

Closer to the edge
Closer to the edge
(No, no, no, no)
Closer to the edge
Closer to the edge
(No, no, no, no)
