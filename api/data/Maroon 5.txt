You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you "no", but my body keeps on telling you "yes"
Try to tell you "stop", but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you (Making me love you)
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go (Let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo (Like a tattoo, yeah)
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Oh)
And I know I've said it a million times (Yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah)

(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And I know I've said it a million times
(Oh, I've said it a million times)
But I'll only stay with you one more night
(Yeah, baby, give me one more night)
So I cross my heart and I hope to die (Yeah, yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah, yeah)
And I know I've said it a million times (Yeah, yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah, yeah)

I dunno
Whatever
 
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "Love"
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "Love"
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoa, whoa-oa)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)

If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (Uh)
Now, I'm at a payphone

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you're sitting 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (For two?)
(Yeah)

If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone
 
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant (Oh), when we're kissing (Yeah)
Feel so different (Yeah)
Baby tell me how did you get so

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold
 
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging, come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are

'Cause girl you're hotter than a Southern California day
Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta  be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar

Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her
Every time she falls, yeah

Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
 
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road, I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
Now, I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you, ooh

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, oh, oh, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
Aha, ah, mmm, ah

Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
