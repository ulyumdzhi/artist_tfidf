Every time that I get around ya
Something takes a hold of my soul
Staring me up until I can't get enough
When you move it makes my sweat turn cold

'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
And now I've got you in the palm of my hand
Get all dramatic, erratic, your moves are automatic
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam

That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam

Every time that I get around ya
Something takes a hold of my mind
Three seconds time, I'm 'bout to redline, singing
Ooh, yeah you shake it so fine

'Cause when you move it slow, my bones start shaking
You move it slow, I can't stop

'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
And now I've got you in the palm of my hand
Get all dramatic, erratic, your moves are automatic
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam
I've got you in the palm of my hand
That's my jam
'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam
But you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam

You know I love the way the girl, them shake it up
Cyaan with men, only gyal, then make it up
I love strong, I make way long, long, long up
Drop the rythm and the gyal, then give it up
Confidence from dusk till dawn
Lock the door and turn the lights on
Exodus from the beat of me bone
Now I'm crawling out by morning
Pour your sugar all over me
Wine that body, take you home with me
Feels so good you've got to raise your hands
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance

Every time that I get around ya
Something takes a hold of my soul
Staring me up until I can't get enough
When you move it makes my sweat turn cold

'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
And now I've got you in the palm of my hand
Get all dramatic, erratic, your moves are automatic
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam

That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam
 
Too much of us caught in a rat trap we ah fe bust out ah that
Too much of us caught in a rat race ah fe bust out ah that

They're in a contest and a competition
Caught in the snare material suction
If what you've got is all you mention
Move on go way I tell you, move on go way I tell you
Pushing and pulling juggling it no stop
There's always free cheese inside a rat trap
You better watch before the snap goes pop
Move on go way I tell you, move on go way I tell you

Don't even bother with the boasting
Just take care, cause this ya rat race ain't fair
Even the saints them are falling
So beware! You'll find no winners in there
You know its gonna get you whoa
And it will never let you go(x2)
Rat trap we can't escape from it whoa!
And it will never let you go whoa whoa(x4)
Can't get out of there

Chatty people they will talk all day
Talk your business and they feel no way
Elaborate and make up the story
Move on go way I tell you, move on go way I tell you
You're always watching what they got next door
If your belly is full and you still want more
Helping the rich when you go down with the poor
Move on go way I tell you, move on go way I tell you

It's a rat race; it's a rat race
Someone, come on, tell me what is wrong with the human race
Fury breaks the chain! Let us go. (x4)
 
Big tings running through my mind
I think about them all the time
I'm gonna do my ting the way I wanna do it
And everything will be alright
Big tings burning up my soul
I think I'm bout to lose control
Do I tell myself that I can get through it?
Maybe I'll never know

Big tings all in my brain
Big tings got me again

Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself

Big tings gonna have their way
I think about them every day
Do I step inside and enjoy the ride?
To hell with what people say

Will I ever be satisfied?
Big tings still on my mind

Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself

I can see them coming over the horizon
I don't think that I can trust myself
I can see them coming over the horizon
I don't think that I can trust myself

Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than you
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than you
I can't trust myself
