Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra
 
If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I might be rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?


And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
 
Oh, my life
Is changing every day
In every possible way
And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
Never quite as it seems

I know I've felt like this before
But now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you
Then I open up and see
The person falling here is me
A different way to be

Ah
La ya
La la ya
La-ah-ah

I want more
Impossible to ignore
Impossible to ignore
They'll come true
Impossible not to do
Impossible not to do

And now I tell you openly
You have my heart so don't hurt me
You're what I couldn't find
A totally amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me

Oh, my life
Is changing every day
In every possible way
And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
'Cause you're a dream to me, dream to me

Ah, la-a-la-ah, la la la
La-a-la-ah, la-ah ah ah
Ah, la-a-la-ah, la la la
La-a-la-ah, la-ah ah ah
 
Understand the things I say
Don't turn away from me
Cause I've spent half my life out there
You wouldn't disagree

Do you see me, do you see?
Do you like me
Do you like me standing there?
Do you notice, do you know
Do you see me, do you see me?
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?

Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design
And people everywhere think
Something better than I am

But I miss you, I miss
Cause I liked it
Cause I liked it
When I was out there
Do you know this, do you know
You did not find me
You did not find
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?

Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
 
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Hold onto love
That is what I do
Now that I've found you
And from above
Everything's stinking
They're not around you
And in the night
I could be helpless
I could be lonely
Sleeping without you
And in the day
Everything's complex
There's nothing simple
When I'm not around you
But I miss you when you're gone
That is what I do
Hey, baby
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew
Hey, baby
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Hold onto my hands
I feel I'm sinking
Sinking without you
And to my mind
Everything's stinking
Stinking without you
And miss you when you're gone
That is what I do
Hey, baby
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew
Hey, baby
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Hey, baby
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Hey, baby
 
Suddenly, something has happened to me
As I was having my cup of tea
Suddenly, I was feeling depressed
I was utterly and totally stressed
Do you know you made me cry? (Woah-oh)
Do you know you made me die?

And the thing that gets to me (Thing that gets to me)
Is you'll never really see (Is you'll never really see)
And the thing that freaks me out (The thing that freaks me out)
Is I'll always be in doubt (Always be in doubt)

It is a lovely thing that we have
It is a lovely thing that we
It is a lovely thing
The animal
The animal instinct
(Whoo-huu-hu, whoo-huu-hu, whoo-huu-hu-uhh)

So take my hands and come with me
We will change reality
So take my hands and we will pray
They won't take you away
They will never make me cry, no (Oh)
They will never make me die

And the thing that gets to me (Thing that gets to me)
Is you'll never really see (Is you'll never really see)
And the thing that freaks me out (The thing that freaks me out)
Is I'll always be in doubt (Always be in doubt)

The animal, the animal, the animal instinct in me
It's the animal, the animal, the animal instinct in me
It's the animal, it's the animal, it's the animal instinct in me
It's the animal, it's the animal, it's the animal instinct in me
The animal, the animal, the animal instinct in me
It's the animal, it's the animal, it's the animal instinct in me
 
There's no need to argue anymore
I gave all I could, but it left me so sore
And the thing that makes me mad
Is the one thing that I had
I knew, I knew
I'd lose you
You'll always be special to me
Special to me, to me
And I remember all the things we once shared
Watching T.V. movies on the living room armchair
But they say it will work out fine
Was it all a waste of time
Cause I knew, I knew
I'd lose you
You'll always be special to me
Special to me, to me
Will I forget in time, ah
You said I was on your mind?
There's no need to argue
No need to argue anymore
There's no need to argue anymore
 
There was a game we used to play
We would hit the town on Friday night
Stay in bed until Sunday
We used to be so free
We were livin' for the love we had
Livin' not for reality

Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was

That was a time I used to pray
I have always kept my faith in love
It's the greatest thing from the man above
The game I used to play
I've always put my cards upon the table
Never be said that I'd be unstable

Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was

There is a game I like to play
I like to hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday
We'll always be this free
We will be livin' for the love we have
Livin' not for reality

It's not my imagination (My imagination)
It's not my imagination (My imagination)
It's not my imagination, it was
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination, it was

Not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my
Not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my
Laa, la-la-la, laa, la-la-la-laa
Laa, la-la-la, laa, la-la-la-laa

My imagination, my imagination
My imagination, my imagination (Not my imagination, not my imagination)
My imagination, my imagination (Not my imagination)
 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh

You'd better believe I'm comin'
You'd better believe what I say
You'd better hold on to your promises
Because you bet, you'll get what you deserve
She's going to leave him over
She's gonna take her love away
So much for your eternal vows
Well, it does not matter anyway

Why can't you stay here awhile?
Stay here awhile, stay with me

Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we made (Promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words
I prayed, prayed, prayed
Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we broke (Promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words
I spoke, spoke, spoke

Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do

What of all the things that you taught me?
What of all the things that you'd say?
What of all your prophetic preaching?
You're just throwing it all away
Maybe we should burn the house down
Have ourselves another fight
Leave the cobwebs in the closet
'Cause tearing them out is just not right

Why can't you stay here awhile?
Stay here awhile, stay with me, oh-oh

Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we made (Promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words
I prayed, prayed, prayed
Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we broke (Promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words
I spoke, spoke, spoke

Oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we made (Promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words
I prayed, prayed, prayed
Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we broke (Promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words
I spoke, spoke, spoke

Oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh
Oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh
Oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do
 
Tell me
Tell me

Somewhere in between here and heaven
Somewhere in between where and why
Somewhere in another dimension
I can hear you asking me why
Why?
Why?

Tell me can you hear me I’m calling
Tell me you can hear me, don’t cry
Tell me that you’re not feeling lonely
Somewhere in between where and why

I will wait for you
Will you wait for me?
I will wait for you
Will you wait for me?
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me

Somewhere at the crossroads of nowhere
Somewhere at the crossroads of why
Somewhere in another dimension
I can hear you asking me why
Why?
Why?

Will you wait for me?
I will wait for you
Will you wait for me?
I will wait for you
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me

Somewhere in between here and heaven
Somewhere in between where and why
Somewhere in another dimension
I can hear you asking me why
