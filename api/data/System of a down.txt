We're rolling "Suicide"

Wake up (Wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
Hide your scars to fade away the shakeup (Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, create another fable, you wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup, you wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup, you wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table? You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder


You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

You!
Why do they always send the poor?

Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels
Victorious Victoriaâ€™s kneel for brand new spanking deals
Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the table cloth

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion, still, you feed us lies from the table cloth

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Blast off, it's party time
And we don't live in a fascist nation
Blast off, it's party time
And where the fuck are you?

Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?

Why do they always send the poor?

Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river and one again after the fall
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life

Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose, oh

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize

I'm not there all the time, you know
Some people, some people, some people call it insane
Yeah, they call it insane (Sugar)
I play Russian Roulette every day, a man's sport
With the bullet called life
Yeah, mama called life (Sugar)
Yeah and every time I try to go where I really want to be
It's already where I am
'Cause I'm already there

The Kombucha mushroom people, sitting around all day
Who could believe you? Who could believe you?

I got a gun the other day from Sako
It's cute, it's small, fits right in my pocket
Yeah, right in my pocket (Sugar)
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes
And I just fucking kick her
And then, ooh baby, she's okay (Sugar)
People are always chasing me down
Tryna push my face to the ground
Where all they do is suck out my motherfucking brains
My brains (Sugar)

The Kombucha mushroom people, sitting around all day
Who can believe you? Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray

I sit in my desolate room
No lights, no music
Just anger, I killed everyone
I'm away forever, but I'm feeling better
How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end, it all goes away

Why don't you ask the kids at Tiananmen Square?
Was fashion the reason why they were there?
They disguise it, hypnotize it
Television made you buy it

I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my

She's scared that I will take her away from there
Dreams and her country left with no one there
Mesmerized the simple-minded
Propaganda leaves us blinded

I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl
I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl


I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl
I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl
 
Such a lonely day and it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life
Such a lonely day, should be banned
It's a day that I can't stand

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day, shouldn't exist
It's a day that I'll never miss
Such a lonely day and it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life

And if you go, I wanna go with you
And if you die, I wanna die with you
Take your hand and walk away


The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day and it's mine
It's a day that I'm glad I survived

Dead man lying on the bottom of the grave
Wondering when savior comes, is he gonna be saved?
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left, God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope, he's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left, all young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home

Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved?
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left, God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope, he's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left, all young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home


Welcome to the soldier side, where there's no one here but me
People all grow up to die, there is no one here but me
Welcome to the soldier side, there is no one here but me
People on the soldier side, there is no one here but me
