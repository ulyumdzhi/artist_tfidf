We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?

Look me in my eyes
Tell me everything's not fine
Oh, the people ain't happy
And the river has run dry
You thought you could go free
But the system is done for
If you listen real closely
There's a knock at your front door

We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?

When there's blood in the
(Oh, oh)
When there's blood in the
(Oh, oh)

Beg me for mercy
Admit you were toxic
You poisoned me just for
Another dollar in your pocket
Now I am the violence
I am the sickness
Won't accept your silence
Beg me for forgiveness

We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?

When there's blood in the water
(Oh, oh)
When there's blood in the
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

I am the people
I am the storm
I am the riot
I am the swarm
When the last tree's fallen
The animal can't hide
Money won't solve it
What's your alibi? (Alibi, alibi)
What's your alibi? (Alibi, alibi)
What's your alibi? (Alibi, alibi)
What you gon' do when there's blood in the
Blood in the water?

When there's blood in the water
(Oh, oh)
When there's blood in the
(Oh, oh)
When there's blood in the water
 
I was higher than the nosebleed, I
Turn up 'til my nose bleed, I
Blacked out in the black car, I
Was trying to feel like a rockstar, but
I can't just do one now, no
I've been way too numb now
I'm living on the run now
Oh, I gotta get out of this town somehow

'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the drugs don't work

Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work

I couldn't find the fill again, I
Couldn't seem to kill the pain, I
Was living in the moment
Searching for a little serotonin
But, this shit ain't so fun now, I
Can't tell what the comedown, I
Been living on the run now
Oh I gotta get out of this town somehow

'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the drugs don't work

Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work

There is no need for anyone to suffer in pain anymore
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Overdose, overdose, overdose
Overdose, overdose, overdose
All fun and games till I hit the floor comatose

Overdose, all fun and games till I hit the floor comatose
Overdose
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Overdose, all fun and games till I hit the floor comatose
Overdose!
 
(No thoughts, no prayers)
(Can bring back what's no longer there)
(The silent are damned)
(The body count is on your hands)

Smile for the camera
Another politician bought
I swear I heard another shot
Cash another payment
Red all on the canvas
It's murder on the campus
Another press conference
Nothing gets accomplished
The suit is an accomplice
Money is the motive
The war is in the street
Watch history repeat

No thoughts and no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

They lobby for the violence
It's a governmental shakedown
Welcome to my breakdown
Bulletproof backpacks
They wanna arm the teachers
I think I saw the reaper
Fear's good for profit
Deregulate the casket
They're lyin' to the masses
How much will it take
'Til you get buried in the coffin that you make?
Heaven's sake

No thoughts, and no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

Turn off all the lights, nobody make a sound
Ashes to ashes, we all fall down
Are we out of time?
Can we turn this all around?
Are we out of time?
Will we all fall?
(We all fall down)

The body count is on your hands
The body count is on your hands
No thoughts (no thoughts)
No prayers (no prayers)
No thoughts (no thoughts)
The body count is on your hands
No thoughts (no thoughts)
No prayers (no prayers)
No thoughts (no thoughts)
The body count is on your hands (on your hands)
 
The goodbye is the hardest part
When we find ourselves back at the start
But I'm not so brave, and I'm not so smart
No, I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor
One day you will understand
Why I pushed you away as I ran
And you will find a better man than I am
Trust, I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor (Ooh)

Despicable, I'm just a bottom feeder
I'm despicable, I ain't never been a keeper
I'm despicable, love her then I leave her
And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
Said if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither

I wouldn't love me neither
Despicable

The boy who fell into the sky
Had no one there to watch him cry
He looked at you with his empty eyes
And said, "I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor" (Ooh)

Despicable, I'm just a bottom feeder
I'm despicable, I ain't never been a keeper
I'm despicable, love her then I leave her
And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
Said if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither

I wouldn't love me neither
Despicable

How I wish I told a different tale
Like we chased the light, and his love prevailed
But his blood ran cold, and his skin went pale
She got a letter in the mail, it said: "I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor"

Said if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
(Love her then I leave her) No
(Love her then I leave her)
Said if I were you
Said if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
 
When I go into the ground
I won't go quietly, I'm bringin' my crown
When I go into the ground
Oh, they gotta bury me, bury me face down

From the rubble, what do I see?
There's a whole damn army thinkin' that they're gonna harm me
Say goodnight, I'll never get free
Oh, I got troubles that won't let me be
But I won't get tired, set the town on fire
'Till my troubles got trouble with me

Thinkin' that they've won
It's only just begun

When I go into the ground
I won't go quietly, I'm bringin' my crown
When I go into the ground
Oh, they gotta bury me, bury me face down

I've been on the run
Since I was a boy
But now I'm done runnin', got another thing comin'
Watch my enemies get destroyed
Oh, I've got troubles of more than one kind
But I never sleep, gotta bury me six feet deep
Where the sun don't shine

Thinkin' that they've won
It's only just begun

When I go into the ground
I won't go quietly, I'm bringin' my crown
When I go into the ground
Oh, they gotta bury me, bury me face down

I've been counted out, left for dead
Wanted with a bounty on my head
But somehow, someway, I'm-a keep movin' along, movin' along
Been counted out, left for dead
Wanted with a bounty on my head
But somehow, someway, I'ma keep movin' along, along

Thinkin' that they've won
It's only just begun

When I go (When I go)
Into that ground (Into that ground)
I won't go quietly (Won't go quietly)
I'm bringin' my crown (Bringin' my crown)
And when I go into the ground (into that ground)
Oh, they gotta bury me (bury me)
Bury me face down (bury me face down)
Oh, they gotta bury me
Bury me face down
 
I never learned from my mistakes
Until I'm too late to do anything
A screen glows in a dark room
Laptop talk of a change that never came
Oh no, no, no

So come show me
Just what to do and how to fix it
I'm lonely
Sitting in this crowded room

All of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh they're still waiting for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along
Oh no, you'll get just what you give
Getting high with your best friends

I'm just reading about flaws that I didn't know I had
Watching ads for things I didn't know I need
Oh no, no, no
Pour a drink just to stop the shakes
Blowing smoke until my eyes bleed
Mm, mm, mm, mm

Oh come show me
Just what to do and how to fix it
I'm lonely
Sitting in this crowded room

All of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh they're still waiting for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along
Oh no, you'll get just what you give
Getting high with your best friends

Sometimes you gotta leave that city to love that city and start all over again
But it doesn't look so pretty to get your hands dirty and start all over again
You gotta leave that city to love that city or else you might get trapped
Oh, you might get trapped
Just like all of my
Just like all of my

Oh, just like all of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh they're still waiting for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along
Oh no, you'll get just what you give
Getting high with your best friends
 
Mm, mm-mm, hmm-mm-mm
Mm, hm, mm

Nobody really cared, so it never really mattered
It never really mattered, so it never really happened
What's the point in fightin' for a happy ever after?
The past keeps hauntin' the future I imagine (Wha—)
All I ever wanted was a little peace and quiet
Just color in the lines, and you'll get it like they promise
If you bite the hand, get louder and defiant
Then you'll see how quickly they come making a deposit

One false move, you're a Kennedy
If you fight it, you're the enemy
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
Where's my head on the podium?
Gas me up, no petroleum
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity

Mass detention, debt collection, misdirection
Got lost, missed intervention
We missed redemption, missed reflection, kissed the weapon
Skipped the lesson, caught an infection
Mass confusion, air pollution
Compromise foreign contribution
Mass epidemic, no mask in a mass, call the medic
Go fast, do I last? Apathetic
Might crash, I'm a hack, I'm pathetic, I know
Times ain't changin', the sun don't show
When the trees won't grow, when the bars keep droppin'
The fake tan on the TV keep talkin'
Just wanna be optimistic
My sanity's gone off, ballistic
Train was leavin', I just missed it
Guess that I'm stuck with this shit, damn

One false move, you're a Kennedy
If you fight it, you're the enemy
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
Where's my head on the podium?
Gas me up, no petroleum
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity

I'm still tryna find my identity

One false move, you're a Kennedy
If you fight it, you're the enemy
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
Where's my head on the podium?
Gas me up, no petroleum
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
 
Now Tommy's a good father
Two sons and a daughter
But he wakes up and he asks himself
"Why even bother?"
If he cannot feed his family
The wage he's paid's insanity
Every day he's dealing with a new calamity
Lost his old occupation
But it wasn't immigration
It was a machine, automation that replaced him
Politicians left him, corruption since the Recession
So he grabs his Smith & Wesson and says he'll teach 'em all a lesson like

"Get down on the ground!
It's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
“It’s a stick-up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”

Now first he'd lost his pension
Sunk into depression
Congress is defecting
It's been adding to the tension
Came back from war, and he's been post-traumatic stressing
Can't afford his medicine he took for his aggression
He needs help, relying on the system that rejects him
Took away his benefits, but left him with his weapon
Bought a one-way ticket
He's entering the thicket
To do the only thing that he's thinking will make a difference like

"Get down on the ground!
It's a stick-up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
“It’s a stick-up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”

There's a cold wind blowing
I'm just warning and preparing ya
There's a cold wind blowing
And it's coming for America!
And it's coming for America!
And it's coming for America

"Get down on the ground!  (On the ground)
It's a stick-up! Nobody make a sound! (Make a sound)
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round! (Emptying a round)
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
“It’s a stick-up! Nobody make a sound! (Nobody make a sound)
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round! (Emptying a round)
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
 
Is it time to lead or is it time to die?
Time to raise hell or walk on by?

Time for peace or is it time for violence?

Do you love a sunset?
Aren't you fed up yet?
Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?

Yeah, yeah
To go and get your hands dirty

I got a skeleton under the floorboard
I got a secret I need you to keep
Run away, run away, you have been forewarned
I don't wanna go off in the deep
If we don't do somethin’, we’ll be stuck up in the mud again
Don't wanna mess it up ’cause I want everything and nothing at all
I've got a feeling when they walkin' on the ceilin'
That the people needed healin’ and they know

Tell me what you tryna hide
And what you runnin' from inside
'Cause I got a surprise
We might not make it to the mornin'
So go on and tell me now

Do you have enough love in your heart

Yeah, yeah

I lose a bit of myself with every selfie
Lose sleep over wealth, it's not healthy
Finding a new religion on Yelp to come help me
Praying to the label itself, "Do not shelf me"
In the middle with the beggars and rejects
Reading between text with weed, liquor, and sex
She say she love me at dusk, but at dawn
I pack up my things and I'm gone

And I don't know where I'm gonna go
But I don't care, I'm on the road
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
Been a lot of places in this life
And I did a lot wrong I can't make right
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
(Said I will not apologize)

I'm imperfect, I'm imperfect
No road map, getting lost on purpose
Phone no service, but it's clear out here
I'm living with nothing to fear out here
There's lessons you learn
Bridges you burn
All for the cost of a dollar to earn
And they say they love me at dusk, but at dawn
I pack up my things and I'm gone

And I don't know where I'm gonna go
But I don't care, I'm on the road
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
Been a lot of places in this life
And I did a lot wrong I can't make right
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
(Said I will not apologize)

(But I will not apologize)

I don't know where I'm gonna go
But I don't care, I'm on the road
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
Been a lot of places in this life
And I did a lot wrong I can't make right
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize

Said I will not apologize
(Yeah, I will not apologize)
