Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

"Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls"
And whispered in the sound of silence
 
Can you feel that?
Ah, shit
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Oh, oh! Oh, oh!
Oh, oh!

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken, your servant, I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)

Looking at my own reflection
When, suddenly, it changes, violently, it changes
Oh, no, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)

It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes, living with these changes
Oh, no, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

And when I dream...
And when I dream...
And when I dream...
And when I dream!

No, Mommy, don't do it again!
Don't do it again, I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, I promise!
No, Mommy, don't hit me!
Why did you have to hit me like that, Mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me!
Why did you have to be such a bitch?
Why don't you? Why don't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just leave here and die?
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch!
Fuck you! I don't need this shit!
You stupid, sadistic, abusive, fucking whore!
How would you like to see how it feels, Mommy?
Here it comes, get ready to die!

Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness has now come over me
 
He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation, I cannot forget

So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

When you die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die, you'll know why
You'll die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die, you'll know why

I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
 
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a blood stained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention

The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless

The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run!

You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a blood stained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
Don't want to mention

The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

Into the abyss will I run
I can't let you go
Yes, I am stricken and can't let you go
 
Devon won't go to heaven
She's just another lost soul about to be mine again
Leave her, we will receive her
It is beyond your control will you ever meet again
Devon, one of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole as a little child
She was taken and then forsaken
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again

Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal

Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

Sever, now and forever
You're just another lost soul about to be mine again
See her, you'll never free her
You must surrender it all if you'd like to meet again
Fire for your desire
As she begins to turn cold for the final time
You will shiver, 'til you deliver
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again

Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal

Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

Take me away, yeah

Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

Devon, one of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole as a little child
She was taken and then forsaken
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again man
 
The image in your eyes
Reflecting the pain that has taken you
I hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame
From what's ailing you

I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you can rise again
So don't give up

When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

Lost in your world of lies
I find it so hard to believe in you
Can it be real this time
Or just a part of this game that we're playing through?

I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you will rise again
I won't give up

When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

Don't let it take your soul
Look at me, take control
We're going to fight this war
This is nothing worth dying for

Are you ready to begin?
This is a battle that we are gonna win

When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

I'll be your reason to fight
Give you a reason to fight
 
Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation: an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again
No explanation will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation, and now, my unfortunate friend
You will discover a war you're unable to win

I'll have you know that I've become

Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
My declaration embedded deep under the skin
A permanent reminder of how it began
No hesitation when I am commanded to strike
You need to know that you're in for the fight of your life

You will be shown how I've become

Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

I'm indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I am indestructible (Indestructible)

Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war
 
Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight, but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
You turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You waited hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow beckoning
Then, your fear seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light

An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid, don't turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind
And reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer, if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light

Sickening, weakening
Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light

Don't ignore, listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light
 
Yeah, bringing you another disturbing creation
From the mind of one sick animal who can't tell the difference
And gets stupified

I've been waiting my whole life for just one fuck
And all I needed was just one fuck
How can you say that you don't give a fuck?
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All I wanted was just one fuck
One tiny, little, innocent fuck
And when I feel like I'm shit out of luck
I find myself stupified, coming back again

Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping away

See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! "It's all the same", you say
Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! I get stupified!

All the people in the left wing, rock
And all the people in the right wing, rock
And all the people in the underground, rock
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All the people in the high-rise, rock
And all the people in the projects, rock
And all gente in the barrio, rock
I find myself stupified, coming back again

Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping away

See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! "It's all the same", you say
Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! I get stupified!

Tefached
Tefached

And don't deny me
No, baby now, don't deny me
And darling, don't be afraid

But I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified!

Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
I begin to stupify

One more goddamn day when I know what I want and my want will be considered tonight
Consider tonight
Just another day
When all that I want will mark me as a sinner tonight
I’m a sinner tonight, yeah

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air

Power unrestrained
Dead on the mark is what we will deliver tonight
Deliver tonight
Pleasure fused with pain
This triumph of the soul will make you shiver tonight
We’ll make you shiver tonight, yeah

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air

We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air

Ten thousand fists in the air
