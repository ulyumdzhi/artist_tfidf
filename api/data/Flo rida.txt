Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

Hey, I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin' X and O
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them

Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy groan
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her

Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know

Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

Whoa, shawty
Yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin'
And them Rosay bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock

Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)

Welcome to my duck-off, the crib, the spot, the pad
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home's draining the sad
Soon as these happy faces land you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown pass
Mi casa es tu casa, so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax

Yo' girl just kissed a girl, I do bi chicks
Shake for a sheik, I'm throwin' these Emirates in the sky
Spendin' this As-salamu alaykum, peace to M-O-N-E-Y
I love my beaches, south beaches, surfboard in high tide
I could just roll up 'cause I'm swole up
So that birthday cake get the cobra
Bugatti for real, I'm cold, bruh

My touch say it's the Midas
We the plus, your man a minus
My team blowin' on that slam
Make you cough-cough, that's Bronchitis

Hey, walk out of the house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll

My Benjamin Frank-a-lins
A couple of grands, I got rubberbands
My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belongs on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me, like dammit I know ya
Doing a show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur ('Cause)

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down

Popping these bottles, touching these models
Watching they asses go

Woke up on the side of the bed like I won

Got adrenaline, never giving in
Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness, I got the heart of twenty men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day

Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh-ooh

Oh, I, I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping music
I might lose it, glass to the roof
That's how we do's it, do's it, do's it
I don't care tonight
She don't care we like
Almost there, the right vibe
Ready to get live
Ain't no surprise
Take me so high
Jump and nose dive
Surfing the crowd
Ooh-ooh
Said I gotta be the man
I'm the head of my band
Mic check, one, two-ooh
Shut 'em down in the club while the playboy does
And they all get loose, loose after bottle
We all get bent then again tomorrow
Gotta break rules 'cause that's the motto
Club shut down: a hundred super models

Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh-ooh

P-p-party rocker, fa' sho' stopper
More Chambull, number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off then I make that move
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Wild out, baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me high pain
Tolerance, bottoms up when the champagne
My life, call my hanna to be explain
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane

Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh-ooh

I am a wild one, break me in (Yeah)
Saddle me up and let's begin (Yeah, yeah)
I am a wild one, tame me now (Now, now)
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body, dominate you 'til you've had enough
I hear you like the wild stuff

Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh-ooh (Oh)
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh-ooh

I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl
 
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next, get a call, just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Buggatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears, dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now

I know
I know
I know
I know
I, I, I, I
I think of letting go, go, go

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little

Hola, hola-la
Quiero conocerte ya
Oh my, oh my God
Aunque no me entiendas voy
Hey ma', hey mama
Don't need no translation, just
Come right here, and make your body say it, yeah yeah

Hola, hola
Make your body say
Hola, hola (Dirty boy, baby)
Make your body say (Dirty boy)

I don't speak your language
But girl, I love that fragrance
You with all that ass, yes
So drop it in rotation
You here for vacation
And I'm here for temptation
I'ma put it on you
Let's see if you can take it

Hola, hola-la (hola, hola)
We should get acquainted like
Oh my, oh my God (hola, hola)
I don't speak your language, but
Hey ma', hey mama (alright, alright, baby)
Don't need no translation, just
Come right here (Maluma, baby)
And make your body say, yeah yeah

Hola, hola
