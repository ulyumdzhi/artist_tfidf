Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort

Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort – suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arms bleeding
Do you even care, if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplatin' suicide

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

I never realized I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm runnin' and I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
I can't go on living this way

Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm runnin' and I'm crying
I can't go on living this way
Can't go on living this way
Nothing's alright
 
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just want to be alone
I'm pissed 'cause you came around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause I've channeled all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is:

I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you goin' down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I’m drunk and I’m feeling down
And I just want to be alone
You shouldn’t have come around
Why don’t you just go home?
'Cause you’re drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn’t understand
(But you didn’t understand)
Go fix yourself!

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life

I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
 
I think I need help
I'm drowning in myself

Did someone turn the lights out?
Or is it just another dark cloud in my head?
'Cause I'm cut deep
My heart won't beat
Deep down low, it's killing me
If I wanna scratch out yesterday
I've got so much I need to say
I've got so much I need to say

I think I need help
'Cause I'm drowning in myself
It's sinking in
I can't pretend that I ain't been through hell
I think I need help
I'm drowning in myself

They're preying on my weakness
Believe it
I'm thinking to myself, no, not again
And I won't keep listening when temptation's creeping in
If I wanna make it another day
I've got so much I need to say
I've got so much I need to say

I think I need help
'Cause I'm drowning in myself
It's sinking in
I can't pretend that I ain't been through hell
I think I need help
I'm drowning in myself

I think I need help
'Cause I put myself through hell

I think I need help
'Cause I'm drowning in myself
It's sinking in
I can't pretend that I ain't been through hell
I think I need help

I think I need help
I think I need help
 
I was there on the day truth died
Blood on my hands throw 'em up in the sky
I was the number one sinner, no less
My life was a lie, and my wish was a death
I fell in love with the ways of the world
Money, the fame, the booze, the girls
But I couldn't stay faithful, if I tried
I turned in to a devil, you could see it in my eyes
I blacked out, told everything I ever did
I couldn't take all the lies I was living with
I broke your heart, woke up the next day
My bags outside, yelling, "Get the hell away!
You're not a husband, not a father, just a pig
And you can't never change all the things that you did!"
That's when I knew it, it wouldn't last
You never get away, when you're running from the past

I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

I'm a broken man, I'm full of sin
I'm sick of all this hell that I'm living in
And I can't escape it, this is how it feels
When you try to numb the pain with a thousand pills
You tore me down, wished that I was dead
Said you wanna sleep alone in another bed
But when I push away, you only pull me closer
It's only over when we both wanna say it's over
I gotta change this is not who I am
I wanna start over wanna try this again
You're everything I need, everything I'm not
So pull the trigger, give me one more shot

I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

You love me, you hate me, you kiss me, you break me
You lifted me up just to watch as you broke me
You promised me, looked me straight in the eyes
No matter what you say, I don't know truth from the lies
I helped you up, like I always do
I forgave you for your sins and I carried you through them
No matter how hard we fought, we always knew
You will bleed for me, and I will bleed for you

Fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
Die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity
I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

Baby, we can float away
 
I want to feel your wreckage
It's a firestorm
I'm falling like a loaded weapon
In your arms
Paranoid, it might be reckless
No matter what I say
It's only going to steal your breath
And slip away

I don't want to dive in first
You don't want to hear these words
It's only gonna make it worse
You don't want to live that curse
You're telling me to keep my hope
'Cause you've got a heart of gold
But maybe you should let me go
I'll love you through a periscope

You wear your heart so fearless
It's like it doesn't breathe
You push away my demons when they torture me
Don't think that I can fight this pressure
Pulling me underneath
It's like I've got the whole world tied around my feet

I don't want to dive in first
You don't want to hear these words
It's only going to make it worse
You don't want to live that curse
You're telling me to keep my hope
Because you've got a heart of gold
But maybe you should let me go
I'll love you through a periscope

Oh, through a periscope
Oh, I-I'll love you through a periscope
Oh, through a periscope
Oh, I-I'll love you through a periscope

I don't want to dive in first
You don't want to hear these words
It's only gonna make it worse
You don't want to live that curse
You're telling me to keep my hope
Cause you've got a heart of gold
But maybe you should let me go
I'll love you through a periscope

Oh, through a periscope
Oh, I-I'll love you through a periscope
 
I am a man at war
And I am fighting for
All of the broken people
All of the people thrown overboard
They always tried to shame us
But they don't speak our language
No, we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

Oh, somebody, sound the alarm
Oh, a fire was set in the dark
Oh, it's time that you know
No, we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

It doesn't matter if the world has gone mad
If we just hold on, if we just hold on, yeah
The sky is falling, and the world has gone mad
And we sing our songs, and we just hold on, yeah
So if you're running, stop running
One life, one chance, start living
Sing it louder just to let the world know
No, we're not nameless, we're not faceless

We were born for greatness
We're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness
We're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

They say that I'm reckless
Because I'm relentless
They spit on my face and curse on my name
They're taking my life in vengeance
Yeah, you can try and blame us
And try to take what’s sacred
But we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

Oh, somebody, sound the alarm
Oh, a fire was set in the dark
Oh, it's time that you know
No, we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

It doesn't matter if the world has gone mad
If we just hold on, if we just hold on, yeah
The sky is falling, and the world has gone mad
And we sing our songs, and we just hold on, yeah
So if you're running, stop running
One life, one chance, start living
Sing it louder just to let the world know
No, we're not nameless, we're not faceless

We were born for greatness
We're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness
No, we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

We’re not nameless, we’re not faceless
We were born for greatness
No, we’re not nameless, we’re not faceless
We were born for greatness

Somebody, sound the alarm
It's time that you know

It doesn't matter if the world has gone mad
If we just hold on, if we just hold on, yeah
Sing it louder just to let the world know
No, we're not nameless, we're not faceless

There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my obsession

I just want to be heard
Loud and clear are my words
Coming from within man
Tell them what you heard
It's about a revolution
In your heart and in your mind
You can find the conclusion
Lifestyle and obsession
Diamond rings get you nothin'
But a lifelong lesson
And your pocketbook stressin'
You're a slave to the system
Working jobs that you hate
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see
Stop thinking about yourself
Start thinking about

There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit

Because everything is nothing, and emptiness is in everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out It's a big black hole
Take your money burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions, they are never going to fill the void
Take it away and learn the best lesson
The heart, the soul, the life, the passion

There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit
Money, possessions, obsession

Present yourself, press your clothes
Comb your hair, clock in
You just can't win, just can't win
The things you own, own you. No!
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit
Fuck your money, fuck your possessions, fuck your obsession
I don't need that shit

Money, possession, obsession
I don't need that shit
 
In the brightest hour of my darkest day
I realized what is wrong with me
Can't get over you, can't get through to you
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
Take these memories that are haunting me
Of a paper man cut into shreds
By his own pair of scissors
He'll never forgive her, he'll never forgive her

Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

Sitting by a fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl, little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You're my heroin
In this moment, I'm lonely, fulfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs, all these women
I'm never forgiven, this broken heart of mine

Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss
 
It feels like, American Dreams caught on fire
We're tearing down the white picket fences
A soldier bleeds, and a soldier dies
Have you ever thought that war was a sickness?
I’m a son of it, fucked up from it
Casualty of my family cause of it
We dare to dream, or live to die
Reunited by the truth at the right time
Something’s wrong here
Or so it seems
'Cause I’m not sleeping in

American Dreams, American lies
We're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it's harder to breathe
When you're buried alive
By American Dreams

With every bullet hole, there's a blood stain
Another family that's struggling to keep sane
'Cause their neighborhood ain't a safe place
Got us all wearing black every Sunday
And I'm growing numb to the violence
Sing along to the sounds of the sirens
We're trying to keep ourselves alive
But it's hard to get by when it feels like
Something’s wrong here
Or so it seems
'Cause I'm not sleeping in

American Dreams, American lies
We're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it’s harder to breathe
When you're buried alive
By American Dreams

'Cause I'm not sleeping in
American Dreams, American lies
We're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it's harder to breathe
When you’re buried alive
By American Dreams

I was young and I was reckless man
Moved out at seventeen and made my momma mad
I thought I had it all figured out
A pocket full of pills and a forty in my mouth
Peeled out in my big black Chevy
Flipped it six times and I knew that I was ready
To straighten up because my best friend died
I didn't wanna carry on living that life

And now I'm running from the scene
'cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me every time
And I'm trying not to scream but it's eating me alive
I'm still haunted by the best years of
The best years of my life

Yeah, lemme take y'all back
I was young and I was helpless man
Self medicating my own depression man
I drank a bottle after breakfast
Took a look in the mirror ripped the rosary off my necklace
Damn
I lost my job so I lost faith
I just saw a baby bump in my girl's waist
I need a drink to feel right
Party with my homies to escape from real life
Yeah, we had it all figured out
A pocket full of pills and a forty in my mouth
But, I never should've let my best friend drive
'cause he's the reason my child will never see me alive
Damn!

Now I'm running from the scene
'cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me every time
And I'm trying not to scream but it's eating me alive
I'm still haunted by the best years of
The best years of my life

All of a sudden nothing matters anymore
He lost it all, his life was scattered on the floor
And now his family's tryna pick up all the pieces
I am locked up in a box, I am a monster
I'm the reason that he's gone
Wish I could take it all back
Press rewind and take a picture of the past
Pause it, feel my heart turn black
My lungs are smoldering, I'm breathing in the ash

Now I'm running from the scene
'cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me every time
And I'm trying not to scream but it's eating me alive
I'm still haunted by the best years of
The best years of my life
I'm still haunted by the best years of
The best years of my life
I'm still haunted by the best years of
