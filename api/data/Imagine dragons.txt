First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
 
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)

Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
(Woah-oh-ohh)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
(Woah-oh-ohh)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
 
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
 
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
 
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Yeah, ah

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
Whoa

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
