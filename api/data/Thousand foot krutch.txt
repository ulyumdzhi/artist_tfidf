This is ya last warning, a courtesy call

I am not afraid
Of the storm that comes my way
When it hits, it shakes me to the core
And makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust
But will you stand with us
Can you feel it
Make it real and
I think it might wash away tonight
Awakened from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just writing

Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is ya last warning, a courtesy call

There's a rumble in the floor
So get prepared for war
When it hits it'll knock you to the ground
When it shakes up everything around
But survival is a must
So will you stand with us
Can you feel it
Make it real and make me feel it
I think it might wash away tonight
Awakened from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just writing

I’m just the boy inside the man
Not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
I’m just a speck inside your hand
You came and made me who I am
I remember where it all began so clearly

I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me
Something I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am

We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far
And we’re all see through, just like glass
And we can shatter just as fast
That light’s been burned out for a while
I still see it every time I pass
It was lost in the corners of my mind
Behind a box of reasons why
I never doubted it was there
It just took a little time to find and even when

I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me something
I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am
We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far
We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far

I’m just the boy inside the man
Not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's a truth that in love and war
Worlds collide and hearts get broken
I want to live like I know I'm dying
Take up my cross, not be afraid

Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend your locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me

Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

It creeps in like a thief in the night
Without a sign, without a warning
But we are ready and prepared to fight
Raise up your swords, don't be afraid

Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me
Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

This is a warning, like it or not
I break down, like a record spinning
Gotta get up
So back off
This is a warning, like it or not
I'm tired of listenin', I'm warning you, don't try to get up
There's a war going on inside of me tonight (Don't be afraid)
There's a war going on inside of me tonight (Don't be afraid)

Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change
It's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know anymore
Thought I had, thought I had it under control
Hear my voice, here it goes, hear it louder than most
Here it goes, hear it (1, 2, 3, 4!)

It's not worth it, it's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over, you don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control, take it out on me
Scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control

You try to move, try to move, try, but don't wanna lose
You so afraid, so afraid, you don't want it to fade
Hear my voice, here it goes, hear it louder than most
Let it go, let it (1, 2, 3, 4!)
It's not worth it, it's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over, you don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control, take it out on me
Scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control


(1, 2, 3, 4!)
It's not worth it, it's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over, you don't have to throw it away

The other night
I had a dream
There was a world full of kings and queens
But it was cold
Dark as the night
We were the fire under moonlit skies
We were divided
We were the same
And we were free
But we all wore chains
We couldn't see it
But we created
A place between truth and overrated

If I could just see it all
Just like a fly on the wall
Would I be able to accept what I can't control?
And would I share what I saw?
Or just sit back and ignore
Like nothing never happened
Haven't seen you before?

I'm on the run from a thief
I let into my head
I know, I hold the keys, so don't be scared
When I turn and shout:
I don't think I need you anymore
Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!
I don't think I need you anymore
Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it!
I wanna live, I wanna be the change
We can all be kings and queens
If we can just learn to believe
If we can just learn to believe

We had a plan to build a wall
A great divide that would never fall
To separate us
From all the pain
And keep the skeletons locked away
And brick by brick
We built it so thick
That it blacked out the sky and all the sunlight
And one by one
We all became numb
We were making the bullets to a broken gun

If I could just see it all
Just like the fly on the wall
Would I be able to accept what I can't control?
And would I share what I saw?
Or just sit back and ignore
Like nothing never happened
And I haven't seen you before?
I'm on the run from a thief
I let into my head
I know, I hold the keys, so don't be scared
When I turn and shout:

I don't think I need you anymore
Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!
I don't think I need you anymore
Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it
I wanna live, I wanna be the change
We can all be kings and queens
If we can just learn to believe
If we can just learn to believe

I don't think I need you anymore
Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!
I don't think I need you anymore
Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it!
I wanna live, I wanna be the change
We can all be kings and queens
If we can just learn to believe

Hold on for a second
If words can be weapons
Then what I say can affect it
They're not just words on a record
And I can choose to respect it
Or choose to infect it
But once that hits the water
It's too late to be selective

If one voice is enough
To make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up
And watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark
One faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart
Before it all falls apart

So stand up, shout it out
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let's make it count
It's a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out
Sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out
And before we depart let's leave a mark
'Cuz light shines brighter in the dark
When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road

So hold on for a moment
If we're not scared of opponents
Then with what we have we can own it
We just plant the seed and keep groanin'
And when that light shines in the mornin'
They'll still be wakin' up yawnin'
We'll be smilin' like we expected
Sweet victory, one method

'Cause one voice is enough
To make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up
And watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark
One faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart
Before it all falls apart
So stand up, shout it out
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let's make it count
It's a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out
Sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out
And before we depart let's leave a mark
'Cuz light shines brighter in the dark

I'm an alien
Cause I'm not of this world
I have a name
But I've been changed, and now I can't stay the same
And I'm a loser if that means I've been lost before
But now I found it, I'm surrounded
Cause you can hear the way it sounded

Like angels singing with a million voices

The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin

I'm a monster if that means I'm misunderstood
Cause its alive and I can't hide it
The energy is rising
And I'm a traitor if that means I've turned on myself
I can't deny it, it's like a riot
And I can't keep it quiet
Like angels singing with a million voices

The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin

Hear me running
Hear me running, running
Hear me running, hear me running, ra-running
Hear me running, hear me

The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hahaha
Let the sparks fly
Hahaha

There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it
Give me three signs that you're awake
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away
Give me ONE if it's real
And TWO if you can feel it
Give me THREE signs that you're awake
It only takes ONE spark
For TWO to fall apart
And THREE more to blow it away
Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

Burn it like it's fading

Two more to believe in
And three shots at why I should wait
Cause I got one more match
Two strikes left
You got 'till three to get out of my way
Give me ONE if it's real
And TWO if you can feel it
Give me THREE signs that you're awake

Cut me like those words you throw
Console me when you want control
Roll me in those lies you've told
But I won't play these games no more and

(Don't run and hide, stand up and fight)
I'm feeling like just letting go
(It's shaking your mind with cause and divide)
It's taking everything I know
(Don't run and hide, stand up inside)
The wheels keep burning
I'm about ready to blow

When I get angry, I feel weak
And hear these voices in my head
Telling me to fall beneath
'Cause they'll make everything okay
How did I get here?
Everything's unclear
I never meant to cause you pain
Give me a reason I can believe in
I need it all this time
Send me a lifeline
Wave if it makes you look good
Smile when you feel like you should
It's hard not to treat this like I could
Heaven help me, it's overwhelming

I know they say that the space between
Can make it stronger then we've ever seen
They might be right, but I disagree
'Cause I've never felt stronger than when you're with me

Sometimes I wonder why you even care
'Cause even when I leave you're always there with me
And like a candle makes a brighter place
This mark you've made on me can't be erased

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you...

I've stood alone and I've fallen down
Your hands were there to pick me off the ground
Sometimes I cry 'cause I can't believe
Your love is big enough to cover me

Sometimes I wonder if you're even there
But when I feel far away you need me there
And like a candle makes a brighter place
This mark you've made on me can't be erased
Yeah...
I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you...
I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you... I wanna be lost

I wanna be lost in you
Like a ship in the night
I wanna get lost in you
Underneath your sky
I wanna be lost in you
Like a ship in the night
So far gone tonight

I wanna be so far gone in you (Tonight)
So far nothing else will ever do (Tonight)
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you...
So far gone in you
In you...
In you...
So far gone in you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
