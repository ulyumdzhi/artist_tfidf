I'm gonna lay you in the ground
Desire, I'm hungry
I hope you feed me
How do you want me, how do you want me?

Hush now baby, there's no need to cry
Let me wipe away those lemon eyes
All your worries, such a waste of time
You can't even see how much you're mine

You're so bitter, bitter, bitter, yellow
Settle, settle, got to settle, down okay
Listen, you listen, you listen, yellow
It's a killer, a killer, a killer, jealousy

Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes, all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away, turn away
Honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine

Hold on baby, careful what you say
You've been drinking someone else's pain
I can't keep on staring at the sun
Yellow, I will have to bite your tongue

You're so bitter, bitter. bitter, yellow
Settle, settle, got to settle down okay
Listen, you listen, you listen, yellow
It's a killer, a killer, a killer, jealousy
Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes, all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away, turn away
Honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine

(All mine)
And the doctor said you're fine (all fine)
Just a case of lemon eyes (all fine)
See I told you were mine (all mine)
(Lemon eyes)

Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes, all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away, turn away
Honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You're weak, broken in a motel
You blink, tears are falling down, down, down
And you're free, free inside your own hell
You speak, "Someone let me out, out, out"

And I can't stop this pain it only grows
Tell me why I always feel alone
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
Show me what I'm really living for

I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna
But it's hard and it's dark and we're doomed from the start, gotta
I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna
But it's hard and it's dark and I'm falling apart, gotta

Your dreams, slowly turn against you
Your feet, sink into the ground, ground, ground
And you bleed, naked in a black room
You scream, "Someone let me out, out, out"

And I can't stop this pain it only grows
Tell me why I always feel alone
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
Show me what I'm really living for
I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna
But it's hard and it's dark and we're doomed from the start, gotta
I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna

"How come most of your songs are sad songs?"
"Well you know, I don't think they're all that sad. I have a few that aren't sad, they're like hopeless, totally hopeless situation. And the rest aren't sad, they're just the way it goes. I mean, you don't think life's sad? But from recognizing the sadness you can put it aside, be happy and enjoy the happy side of life."

I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna

When all is said and done
Tell me how to write this, tell me how to fight this war
I'll keep marchin' on
Like a broken robot, money back guarantee

I'm in your custody
But I'm not a criminal, I can be your next big thing
Look at what I've become
Silly little monster, should've just held my tongue

I hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
If you force it, it won't come, I guess I'm feeling
Numb
I guess I'm feeling
Numb

Sometimes I wish I could fly
Through a secret trap door, into another life (life)
Bury my head in the sand
I don't want to grow up, la la la la la la la
I hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
If you force it, it won't come, I guess I'm feeling
Numb
I guess I'm feeling
Numb

I'll play the game, I'll do everything you tell me
All the losers win in the end
I'll play the game, I'll do anything you tell me
All the losers win in the end

I hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
If you force it, it won't come, I guess I'm feeling
Numb
I guess I'm feeling
Numb
I guess I'm feeling numb
I guess I'm feeling

It doesn't hurt me
Do you want to feel how it feels?
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?

It's you
It's you and me

And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy

And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh

You
It's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy

Come on, baby
Come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
So, if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems (For the ones we love)

Say, if I only could (If I only could)
With no problems (There's so much hate for the ones we love)
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that hill2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I couldn't sleep last night
There were lions and bears tearing you from my side
I couldn't sleep last night
How you look like my daughter, it's burned in my mind

And I can't feel anything the morning after you
And I can't tell anyone the morning after you

I couldn't sleep last night
You were chasing the birds till the beast caught your eye
I couldn't sleep last night
How you look like an angel, it's burned in my mind

And I can't feel anything the morning after you
And I can't tell anyone the morning after you

And I hope you sleep with a merry gold
I hope you win it this time
And I pray you don't fear the animals
I'll save you, I promise this time
I couldn't sleep last night
There were lions and bears tearing you from my side
I couldn't sleep last night
How you look like my daughter, it's burned in my mind

And I can't feel anything the morning after you
I would give anything1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
My heart is wasted, cut up like a drug
And your tears they taste like vinegar in blood
And these conversations choke us till we're numb
No matter what we're saying, it never seems enough

So take me to the start
Take me to that kiss
Because I got to know, baby, what I'll forget

Sorry that I lost our love, without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love, it really hurts sometimes
And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want, what do you want me to say?
Sorry that I lost our love, until the end of time

My voice is twisted, guilty goes the tongue
Your eyes are faded, they used to turn me on
And our skin is dangerous, villians when we touch
No matter what we're feeling, it never feels enough

So take me to the start
And take me to that kiss
Because I got to know, baby, what I'll forget
Sorry that I lost our love, without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love, it really hurts sometimes
And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want, what do you want me to say?
Sorry that I lost our love, until the end of time

Sorry that I lost our love, without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love, it really hurts sometimes

And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want, what do you want from me
So sorry, sorry, what do you want, what do you want me to say
Sorry that I lost our love, without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love, it really hurts sometimes
And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want, what do you want me to say
Sorry I lost our love, until the end of time8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Just wanna dance with you all night
When everyone has their disguise
I'll show you my heart is real
I'll show you how this could feel

This moment shaking in my hands
I'll share this secret for a chance
Just to be here with you
Just to get lost with you

When it's cold, I just wanna feel your touch
When it's cold, there's nobody else I'd rather know

I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

I'm writing letters in my head
I sign my name but never send
All of my thoughts are you
All of my mind's on you
I stole this sweater from your car
So I'd have you all night in my arms
Now as I go to sleep
I got you here with me

When it's cold, I just wanna feel your touch
When it's cold, there's nobody else I'd rather know

I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat

I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
