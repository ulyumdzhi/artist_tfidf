All we do is hide away
All we do is, all we do is hide away
All we do is chase the day
All we do is, all we do is chase the day

All we do is lie and wait
All we do is, all we do is lie and wait
All we do is feel the fade
All we do is, all we do is feel the fade

I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground
I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground

All we do is hide away
All we do is, all we do is hide away
All we do is chase the day
All we do is, all we do is chase the day
All we do is play it safe
All we do is live inside a cage
All we do is play it safe
All we do, all we do

I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground
I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground

All we do is hide away
All we do is, all we do is hide away
[All we do is chase the day
All we do is, all we do is chase the day]
All I did was fail today
All I wanna be is whites in waves
All I did was fail today
All we do, all we do29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Step out into the sun
Skies above they radiate me
Lift up, carry the love
Do you know?
That I've been out of my mind
This slow life I'm waiting for you
To swing me all of your light
Do you know?

Since I've been walking solo
Dreaming you were back home
Hi fi getting down low
Hide until tomorrow
Come back into the good life
Lose these hazy love lines
I've been chasing my mind
Lonely in the cold nights

Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

Step out into the dark
Where were you when I was trying
To lift up, carry the love
Do you know?
That I've been closing my eyes
Love me slow, hallucinating
Swinging me all of your light
Do you know?

Since I've been walking solo
Dreaming you were back home
Hi fi getting down low
Hide until tomorrow
Come back into the good life
Lose these hazy love lines
I've been chasing my mind
Lonely in the cold nights
Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

Hold me close when it's over
Life goes slow loving sober
Feel my bones getting older
Sadness grows when you go
'Cause I am one step heavy and two steps high
Holding steady with you by my side
One step heavy and two steps high
Two steps high

Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

Without you
Without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Downtown we let it go
Sunset high and our bodies low
Blood rush in the hazy glow
My hands, your bones
Looser we break the scene
One step deep as you fall to me
Heart clap, we skip a beat
Count one, two, three

And don’t you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a place and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Your name I’ll never know
As we get down in the world below
Caught up in an overflow
My hands, your bones
Wide eyed, you look at me
Set on fire in a silver dream
Spin round you can feel the breeze
Count one, two, three

And don’t you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a place and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are from the start
Won't you dance with me?
Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are chasing stars
Won't you dance with me?
Won't you dance with me?

And don’t you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a place and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it'

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it (all), (we gotta) lose it, lose it (all)
We gotta lose it
Lose it (all), (we gotta) lose it, lose it (all)
We gotta lose it
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it35EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I know it hurts sometimes but
You'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
But you'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it

So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

I know your hope is heavy but
You'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
And I know you feel like everything
Is fallen to the wind
But don't you let the thunder in
'Cause I know you'll get over it
So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

You fell down by the wayside
Love-locked in an overflow
And you threw stones at the starlight
As I stood on the sideline telling you
That I get that you're lonely
And I see that you feel alone
But I'll hide in your heartbeat
I'll be there for you, you know

So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sat back with the window down
Eighty an hour and the radio loud
The same songs with the same old rhymes
Tell me to shake it off and swing from the lights

But I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me

Cause loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you

Count stacks of the routine lies
Funny how easy you could see my blindside
Still the same songs with the same old beats
Sure, I could stay, but there’s a place I’d rather be
And I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me

Cause loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you

See, I remember all the times you made me covered in crazy
I can’t forget about the way you played me
Like I was never gonna change your world
It ended long ago, so please just let me go
It ended long ago, so please just let me go

Cause loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
All I do, all I do
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Lay down your slow
Come settle down, settle down
Let loose your glow
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5am light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat
Beat, beat, beat

Warm, unalone
Come settle down, settle down
Swing me your bones
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5am light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire
Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat, beat

Give me one drop, I can feel you
Make me lose control
We'll be walking, on the water
When we're moving in a technicolour beat
Moving in a technicolour beat

Jump into the heat (falling off the ceiling)
Spinning on our feet (we're moving)
In a technicolour beat, you and me (found another feeling)
Caught up in a dream (we're moving), in a technicolour beat
Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet (we're moving)
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream (we're moving), in a technicolour beat

Beat, beat28EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to run through the heat of the sun
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to fall, so tired of it all
Down deep in a hole, can't do it alone
I'm ready to climb this mountain inside
Impossible heights

Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Here with me

I'm ready to go, I’m ready to go
Can't do it alone, can’t do it alone
I’m ready to run through the heat of the sun
Can’t do it alone, can't do it alone
I’m ready to hope, swing me out of the low
Wide awake in the glow, can't do it alone
I’m ready to fly, uncover the light
Impossible heights
Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
I need you right here with me
Here with me

(Whoa)
(Woo-oa)
(Woo-oo)

Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
I need you right here with me18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Lovesick the beat inside my head
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
Lights out solo in the blue
Before I found you

Days passed slowly, lost and low
You gave me hope and now there's only

Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun
Ever since you came, I'm living ultralife
I'm living ultralife
I'm living ultralife

Turn down the voice inside my head
Cos heaven only knows why we feel this emptiness
But I will climb out, find another view
Now I've found you
Days passed slowly, lost and low
You gave me hope and now there's only

Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun
Ever since you came, I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me
Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)

(Ultralife with me)
Found me on a basement floor (Ultralife with me)
Back when I had lost it all (Ultralife with me)
Told me what the fight was for (Ultralife with me)
And I'm not giving up no more (Ultralife with me)
You elevate the life in me (Ultralife with me)
Illuminate the in-between (Ultralife with me)
Forever gonna feel this free (Ultralife with me)
And I'm not giving up now
Lovesick the beat inside my head
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
Lights out solo in the blue
But now I've found you

Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun
Ever since you came, I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
Oh, we're living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me, oh)
We're living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
I'm living ultralife

Before you came round, my heart would never beat much faster
Before you came round, I was ready to slow down
Before you came round, I was heading for a small disaster
Before you came round, I was ready to blow me down

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

Before I was found, I felt like I could drain the ocean
Before I was found, I didn't want to breathe out
Now my soul beats a sound, loud enough to quiet the thunder
A love with no doubt, and now I'm never gonna slow down
Never gonna slow down

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
Let it go, paint my body gold
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
On the ground, on the ground, on the ground

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
Let it go, paint my body gold
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

(And we will walk with our feet on the ground)
Let it go, paint my body gold
(And we will talk with our head in the clouds)
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
(And we will walk with our feet on the ground)
We can go, until the morning glow
(And we will talk)
We can go higher and higher and higher10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
'Cause I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right
I'll walk the world for you
Doing it right, doing it right
Seconds, minutes, hours, lifetimes
Doing it right, doing it right
I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right

Hands up for a miracle
Up high for a miracle
Oh the smoke don’t stop but we let it go
But we let it go on and on
Flash back to a year ago
Count stacks, fifty-two ago
All the hope, drop down like a domino
But we let it go on and on

Will someone take a ride with me?
Back to the world where we can see
Echo strong, river deep
Concrete hazy
Won’t you take a ride with me?
Take a ride with me
It’s easy come never go
Please make way for telephones
Call me crazy, call me slow
Go hang up but
Won’t you take a ride with me?
Come on take a ride with me

'Cause I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right
I’ll walk the world for you
Doing it right, doing it right
Seconds, minutes, hours, lifetimes
Doing it right, doing it right
I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right

Hands up for a miracle
Up high for a miracle
Oh the smoke don’t stop but we let it go
But we let it go on and on
Flash back to a year ago
Count stacks, fifty-two ago
All the hope, drop down like a domino
But we let it go on and on
Will someone take a ride with me?
Back to the planet sanity
Desert plain, ocean wave
Techno crazy
Won’t you take a ride with me?
Take a ride with me
It’s easy come, never go
Please make way for climaphobes
Two degrees, you’re spilling seas
Toupée queen
Oh, won’t you take a ride with me?
Come on take a ride with me

Swing sweet light this earth of mine

'Cause I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right
I’ll walk the world for you
Doing it right, doing it right
Seconds, minutes, hours, lifetimes
Doing it right, doing it right
I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right
